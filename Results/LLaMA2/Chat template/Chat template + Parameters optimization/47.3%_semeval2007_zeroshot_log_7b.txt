The frequency of this sense of "want" (15) is consistent with the context of the sentence, as the speaker is being asked about a specific action or activity that they may or may not want to participate in.

Sense Number: 2 - small thin inflatable rubber bag with narrow neck

The context of the sentence "When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion" suggests that the word "balloon" refers to a small, thin, inflatable rubber bag with a narrow neck, rather than a large, tough, non-rigid bag filled with gas or heated air (sense number 1). This is because the sentence implies that the balloon is moving smoothly and steadily through the air, which is more consistent with the definition of a small, inflatable rubber bag than a large, non-rigid bag. Additionally, the frequency of this sense of the word "balloon" (1) suggests that it is the more commonly used sense in this context.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence "When the balloon is cruising along at a steady altitude there is little sense of motion" suggests that the speaker is using the word "cruise" to mean "travel at a moderate speed." This sense of the word is the most appropriate in this context, as it aligns with the idea of the balloon moving steadily through the air without any sudden changes in direction or speed.

The frequency of this sense of the word "cruise" in a large corpus of texts supports this interpretation, as it appears twice as often as the other senses of the word. The example sentence provided also supports this sense, as it mentions the plane reaching "cruising altitude," which is a common term used in aviation to refer to the altitude at which an aircraft is able to maintain a steady and efficient flight path.

Therefore, the most appropriate sense of the word "cruise" in this context is sense number 2, which means "travel at a moderate speed."

The context of the sentence "Only when one is ascending -- or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel , well , airborne in a picnic basket ." suggests that the most appropriate sense of "ascend" is sense number 1, which defines the word as "travel up". This sense is supported by the frequency of the word in a large corpus of texts, which is 3, indicating that it is a commonly used sense of the word. The example sentence provided also supports this sense, as it describes the feeling of being airborne in a picnic basket, which is more likely to occur when traveling upward rather than going back in order of genealogical succession, becoming king or queen, appearing to be moving upward, or moving to a better position in life or to a better job.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence "Only when one is ascending -- or in our case descending a tad trop rapidement -- does one feel , well , airborne in a picnic basket ." suggests that the speaker is using the sense of "descend" that means "come from; be connected by a relationship of blood, for example". This sense is the most appropriate choice because the speaker is using the word "descend" to refer to the speaker's ancestry or lineage, rather than the physical act of moving downward.

The frequency of this sense of "descend" (3) is consistent with the context of the sentence, as the speaker is using the word to refer to their family history rather than a physical action. The example provided ("She was descended from an old Italian noble family") further supports this interpretation.

The other senses of "descend" do not fit as well in the context of the sentence. Sense number 1 (move downward and lower, but not necessarily all the way) is not relevant to the sentence, as the speaker is not describing a physical action. Sense number 3 (do something that one considers to be below one's dignity) is also not relevant, as the speaker is not using the word to describe an action or behavior. Finally, sense number 4 (come as if by falling) is not a valid sense of "descend" and is not supported by the context of the sentence.

Response: Sense Number: 1

Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence "Attention, yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal" suggests that the speaker is referring to the second sense of "yell," which means to utter or declare in a very loud voice.

The frequency of the second sense of "yell" in a large corpus of texts also supports this choice, as it appears 6 times more frequently than the first sense.
