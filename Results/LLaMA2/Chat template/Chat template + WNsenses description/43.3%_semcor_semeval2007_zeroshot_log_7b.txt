Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "refer", I believe the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 2 (be relevant to)"

In the given context, the author is using the term "refer" to indicate that something is related or connected to something else. For instance, the author states that the research mentioned in the editorial "The Ill Homeless" refers to the general college situation, specifically the preparatory schools. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the intended meaning of the word "refer" in this context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "research" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – a search for knowledge.

This sense is supported by the fact that the passage mentions the author's publication of their views on chemical laws in French translation, which suggests that they were engaging in scientific inquiry or investigation to gain knowledge in their field. Additionally, the mention of "ideas" as the primary objectives of historical study further supports this sense, as it implies a focus on seeking knowledge rather than simply reporting existing findings.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word 'report' is:

    Sense Number: 2 – Announce as the result of an investigation or experience or finding.

This sense fits best because the text mentions "research by us and six of our colleagues" that was reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It implies that the author is referring to the act of announcing or presenting the results of a study or investigation, rather than simply giving an account of something in words or making a complaint.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "comment" is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense of "comment" matches the meaning of the word in the given context: a personal opinion or belief, or additional information. The example sentence you provided supports this interpretation as well, as it implies that the speaker is expressing their own thoughts and opinions rather than referring to a written critique or explanation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word 'imply', I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate.

"Sense Number: 1"
Response: 
"Sense Number: 2"

The context of the given sentence implies that "discover" means "get to know or become aware of," usually accidentally. This sense aligns well with the examples provided, particularly the second one, where the speaker expects the protagonist to discover something without being told explicitly. The other senses do not fit quite as well in the context, as they refer to different meanings of the verb "discover."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word 'cause', I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - a justification for something existing or happening

In the given sentence, the author implies that there is a reason or explanation why homelessness exists in large numbers among certain groups, such as those with mental illness or substance abuse issues. Therefore, sense 2 best fits the context because it refers to a justification or explanation for something existing or happening.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 2: "discover or determine the existence, presence, or fact of".

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: 
Sense Number: 1
The word “make” in the given sentence means “engage in”.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided ("We have made no such statement"), I believe the most appropriate sense of the word "statement" is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition given for this sense is: "a message that is stated or declared; a communication (oral or written) setting forth particulars or facts etc." This fits well with the context, as it implies that there has been no formal announcement or declaration made by the speaker or writer.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "become," I would choose sense number 2: "undergo a change or development."

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense as it mentions something becoming a "giveaway program" which implies a change from its original purpose or nature. Additionally, the frequency count for this sense (8) is higher than any other sense, indicating that it is the most commonly used meaning of the word in this context.

Here is an example sentence using this sense: "Have you permitted it to become a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee morale and, consequently, increased productivity?"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word 'cause', I would say that the most appropriate sense for the context is:

Sense Number: 2

In this context, the word 'cause' seems to be used as a synonym for 'reason'. The phrase 'the causes of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case' suggests that the speaker is referring to the underlying reasons or motivations behind homelessness, rather than a specific event or action that led to it. Therefore, sense number 2, which defines 'cause' as a justification for something existing or happening, best fits the context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the available information, I would say that the best definition of "understand" in this scenario is:

Sense Number: 1

Definition: Know and comprehend the nature or meaning of.

Explanation: In this context, the author seems to be using "understand" to mean having knowledge of or being aware of something, particularly in relation to the cause(s) of homelessness. Therefore, option 1 best fits the bill as it implies a broad understanding of the concept rather than just mental perception or belief.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word 'quote', I would choose sense number 3: "refer to for illustration or proof".

The context of the sentence provides evidence that the speaker is referring to previous research or examples when they say "In quoting from our research...", which aligns with the definition of sense number 3. Additionally, the use of the phrase "He said he could quote several instances of this behavior" suggests that the speaker is drawing upon prior knowledge or examples to support their argument, further supporting this sense.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 3"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "emphasize" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Give extra weight to (a communication)

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense, as the speaker is highlighting something that was already mentioned earlier in the conversation. The phrase "whatever pole" also implies a deliberate act of drawing attention to something, which aligns with the second definition of "emphasize". Additionally, the example sentence provided supports this sense, as it shows how the speaker's gesture reinforced their words.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, I would choose Sense Number 2: "notice or perceive". In this context, the speaker is using the verb "note" to mean "notice" or "perceive", rather than "make mention of", "observe with care", or "make a written note of". The phrase "had noted" also supports this interpretation, implying that the speaker is referring to something that happened in the past. Therefore, the best answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "people" is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition given for this sense matches the meaning of the word in the context of the passage: "any group of human beings (men or women or children) collectively." The example sentence also supports this interpretation, as it refers to a diverse group of individuals who are being examined for various health issues.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the verb "examine" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2

The definition of this sense matches the context perfectly: "observe, check out, and look over carefully or inspect." In the given sentence, the speaker is talking about examining the homeless people they encountered, which fits with the sense of looking over or checking them out. The other senses do not seem to fit as well in the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "have" is:

Sense Number: 1

The context suggests that the speaker is using "have" in the sense of "possess or own." The phrase "the homeless people we examined had a multitude of physical disorders..." implies that the speaker is referring to a group of individuals who possess or own these physical disorders. Therefore, sense number 1 is the most fitting option.
Response: Based on the given context, I would choose Sense Number 1 as the best fit for the ambiguous word "multitude" in the sentence:

"Sense Number: 1 - a large indefinite number"

The definition and example provided for this sense match well with the meaning conveyed by the sentence. The phrase "a multitude of physical disorders" suggests a large and diverse group of conditions, which fits better with the first sense than the other two options. Additionally, the absence of any specific example for Sense Number 2 makes it less likely to be the correct interpretation.
Response: Sure! I can help you determine the correct meaning of the term "suffer" in the sentence you gave us. After carefully reviewing all ten potential meanings of "suffer," as well as the examples provided, I believe the best fit for the intended meaning here is...

Sense Number: 2 – Undergo (as of injuries and illnesses)

In the given sentence, the term "suffer" seems primarily related to the idea of experiencing physical or mental harm, which aligns with definition #2. Specifically, the phrase "they suffered from malnutrition, chest diseases, cardiovascular disorders, skin problems, infectious diseases, and the aftereffects of assaults and rape" highlights the various medical conditions and traumas experienced by the people mentioned. Given this context, the second definition of "suffer" seems the most plausible choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "people" is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for this sense matches well with the context provided: "Are you careful to restrict the number of people on leave at one time so that your total employment obligation is minimized?" clearly refers to a plural noun meaning any group of humans (men, women, or children), which aligns with the first sense of the word. Additionally, the usage of the word "people" as a collective term is more frequent in everyday language compared to other senses, making it the most likely interpretation in this context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word 'lack', I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense of 'lack' fits well with the context of the passage, which describes the various ways in which homeless people are deprived of essential needs such as safety, privacy, shelter, nutrition, cleanliness, and basic healthcare. The phrase "they lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men" supports this interpretation, as it suggests that the speaker is comparing the popularity or appeal of two different things, and highlighting the fact that homeless people do not have the same level of appeal or success as something else.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "shelter" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: a structure that provides privacy and protection from danger

The sentence provided in the context highlights the need for protection and safety, which aligns with the first definition of "shelter". Additionally, the other examples provided do not fit as well in the context, as they refer to different types of structures or coverings that provide protection, rather than addressing the issue of safety and protection directly.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'lack', the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for this sense fits well with the context of the passage, which highlights the various ways in which homeless people are deprived of essential needs such as safety, privacy, shelter, nutrition, cleanliness, and basic healthcare. The sentence "They lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men" supports this interpretation, as it implies that the speaker is comparing the popularity or appeal of two groups, with the second group (The Charles Men) being more widely known or appreciated.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, the most appropriate sense of "necessity" is:

Sense Number: 2 - anything indispensable.

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense as it highlights the idea that homeless people lack even the most fundamental necessities like food, hygiene, and basic medical care. Therefore, the term "necessity" in this context refers to something that is indispensable or crucial for survival, which aligns better with the definition of sense 2 than sense 1.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would choose Sense Number 2: "point out carefully and clearly".

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense as the author is discussing specific examples of schools and their appearances, which aligns with the definition of "point out" as to draw attention to something by citing examples or instances. Additionally, the phrase "in every instance" further supports this sense as it implies a careful and deliberate pointing out of details.

Therefore, the answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate meaning of "problem" in the passage:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense of "problem" matches the context perfectly: "a state of difficulty that needs to be resolved." In the passage, the author mentions three categories of health problems that can lead to homelessness, including those that are a consequence of homelessness itself, those that are difficult or impossible to treat without adequate shelter, and those that predispose a person to homelessness. This fits well with the idea of "problem" as a state of difficulty that needs to be addressed or resolved.

The frequency of this sense of "problem" in a large corpus of texts also supports this interpretation. According to the information provided, this sense of "problem" appears relatively frequently, which suggests that it is a common and widely-used meaning of the term.

Finally, the example sentence provided further reinforces this interpretation by highlighting the need to resolve a specific problem (i.e., determining whether Johnston and the murderer are one and the same) rather than simply raising a question or identifying a source of difficulty.
Response: Sure! I can help you with identifying the correct sense of the ambigious word "predispose" based on its context and available information. After analyzing the given text and the provided senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "predispose" in this context is:

Sense Number: 1 - Make susceptible

The definition provided for this sense matches well with the meaning conveyed by the context of the passage. In particular, the phrase "may predispose a person to homelessness" implies that certain conditions or circumstances can increase the likelihood of someone becoming homeless, which aligns with the first sense of "predispose". Additionally, the example provided ("This illness predisposes you to gain weight") also supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the available information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "person" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: a human being

The context of the passage mentions "a person," which could refer to any individual human being, rather than specifically referring to their body or a particular group of people. Additionally, the examples provided suggest that the author is using "person" as a general term to refer to individuals, rather than as a specific category of grammar or a particular part of the body. Therefore, option 1 best fits the context of the passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "category," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 – Definition: a general concept that marks divisions or coordinations in a conceptual scheme

The context of the passage highlights the use of "category" as a broad term to classify different types of health problems according to their underlying causes. The phrase "a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter" further supports this interpretation, as it implies that there are multiple categories of health problems that can have varying degrees of difficulty when it comes to treatment. Therefore, the second definition of "category" as a general concept that marks divisions or coordinations in a conceptual scheme best fits the meaning of the text.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "compose" is:

    Sense Number: 3

The context suggests that the author is using the verb "compose" to mean "produce a literary work." The phrase "put together out of existing material" also supports this interpretation, as the author mentions "news pictures" that have been assembled into a cohesive narrative. The examples provided in each of the other senses do not fit as well with the context, particularly sense 1 ("form the substance of"), which refers to the creation of something new, whereas the author is discussing the assembly of existing materials; sense 2 ("write music") does not seem relevant here either; sense 4 ("put together out of existing material") could potentially apply to the construction of a documentary, but the context does not explicitly mention this; and sense 5 ("calm someone, especially oneself") is unrelated to the discussion at hand.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "lack" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Be Without

The definition you provided ("be without") fits well with the meaning of the sentence as a whole, which discusses various factors that can contribute to a person becoming homeless. Additionally, the frequency count for this sense of "lack" (2) supports its selection, as it is the most common sense of the word in the given corpus. Finally, the example sentence provided nicely illustrates how this sense of "lack" can be used to convey the idea of something being absent or unavailable, which aligns with the overall meaning of the passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "shelter" is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided for this sense fits well with the context of the passage, where the author is discussing various factors that can lead to homelessness and the importance of providing adequate shelter as protection from danger. The example provided also supports this sense, as it refers to the cost of food and shelter, suggesting that these are two separate expenses. Therefore, I believe that the first sense of "shelter" is the best fit for the context provided.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'interaction' in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: a mutual or reciprocal action; interacting

This sense of the word fits best with the context provided because it refers to the complex and multifaceted nature of the relationship between health and homelessness, which cannot be reduced to simple causal relationships. The phrase "defying sweeping generalizations" also supports this interpretation, as it implies that there are many factors at play and no clear cause-and-effect relationship can be identified. The example provided further reinforces this sense, as it mentions the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing these issues, rather than simplistically attributing them to one factor or another.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "defy" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Elude, especially in a baffling way

In the given sentence, the author is trying to convey that the relationship between health and homelessness is complicated and cannot be reduced to simple generalizations. The use of "defy" in this context implies that there is a lack of clear causality or predictability in their interaction, which aligns best with the second definition of the word.
Response: Sure! I can help you with identifying the correct sense of the ambigious word "generalization" in the given context. After analyzing the possible senses provided, I believe the most appropriate sense for the word in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense of "generalization" aligns well with the context provided: "reasoning from detailed facts to general principles". The author mentions that making generalizations about the relationship between health and homelessness is difficult due to the complexity of the issue, which supports the idea of using generalization to refer to drawing conclusions based on specific examples rather than sweeping statements. Additionally, the example provided in the sense definition ("It is possible to make a few generalizations about the six giants themselves") further reinforces this interpretation.
Response: Sure! I have analyzed the given context and the available information, and I believe the best sense of the ambiguous word 'look_to' in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – be excited or anxious about

The context you provided suggests that the speaker is looking forward to the future with anticipation and concern, rather than turning their attention away from it. The phrase "preventing homelessness" implies a specific goal or objective that the speaker wants to achieve, which aligns better with the second definition of 'look_to'. Additionally, the examples provided in the other senses do not fit as neatly into the context as this sense does.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "prevent" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Stop someone or something from doing something or being in a certain state.

The context of the sentence "If we look to the future, preventing homelessness is an important objective." suggests that the speaker wants to stop or hinder homelessness from occurring in the future. Therefore, the second definition of "prevent," which refers to stopping or halting an activity or condition, is the most suitable choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "require" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Consider obligatory; request and expect.

The sentence you provided highlights the idea of requiring something as necessary or essential, which aligns with the definition of this sense of "require". For instance, the phrase "It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and, in addition, required kosher food" demonstrates how the speaker is using "require" to convey that something is necessary or expected, rather than simply desirable or useful.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best sense of "develop" in this passage is:

Sense Number: 2 - Work out

The context of the passage mentions the need to develop a "more sophisticated understanding" of homelessness, which aligns with the definition of "work out". Additionally, the phrase "It was not always easy to develop theory and doctrine" supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! I'm happy to help you with WSD. Based on the given context and the four possible senses of the word "understanding," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: the cognitive condition of someone who understands

In this context, the author is using the term "understanding" to refer to the mental state of having comprehension or knowledge about something. The phrase "a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness" implies that the speaker wants to gain a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the complex issues surrounding homelessness. Therefore, sense number one best fits the meaning of the text.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the available information, I would choose sense number 2: "have ownership or possession of". In this case, the speaker is using the verb "possess" to indicate that they own or have possession of something, which aligns with the definition provided for sense number 2.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word "develop" in the sentence "This will require us to develop a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness than we currently possess," is:

Sense Number: 2 - Work out
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word 'study', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - Definition: applying the mind to learning and understanding a subject (especially by reading)

In this context, the phrase 'a study by Tulane Prof. James Wright says' implies that the word 'study' refers to a research or analysis conducted by Professor Wright, which aligns with the second definition of the word as meaning 'applying the mind to learning and understanding a subject'. Additionally, the example sentence provided further supports this interpretation as it mentions the professor's involvement in conducting the study.
Response: 
"Sense Number: 2"

The given sentence "He 's just heard from the pathologist who says Mrs. Meeker apparently died from suffocation" supports the second definition of "say" which means "report or maintain". In this context, the speaker is reporting what they have heard from someone else, specifically a pathologist, regarding the cause of Mrs. Meeker's death.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "study," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 2 - Definition: applying the mind to learning and understanding a subject (especially by reading)"

This sense fits best in the context because it aligns with the meaning of the verb "to study" as a general term for learning something through reading or intellectual effort. In this context, the author is discussing a research study that involved analyzing data to understand a particular issue, which aligns well with the definition of "study" as applying the mind to learning and understanding a subject.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the available senses, I would choose sense number 2: "establish the validity of something, as by an example, explanation or experiment".

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambigious word "make_up" is:

        Sense Number: 9

In this context, the phrase "made up" can be interpreted as meaning "apply make-up or cosmetics to one's face to appear prettier". This interpretation aligns with the definition and example provided for sense number 9.
Response: Sure! I will be happy to help you out with identifying the correct sense of the ambigious word "exhibit" in the given context.

Based on the information provided, the most appropriate sense of "exhibit" in this context is:

Sense Number: 1

This sense of "exhibit" means to show or demonstrate something, typically to an interested audience. In the context of the passage, the phrase "nearly 40% of the homeless population is made up of women and children and that only 25% of the homeless exhibit some combination of drug, alcohol, and mental problems" suggests that the author is using "exhibit" to mean showing or demonstrating the proportion of different groups within the homeless population.
Response: Sure! I'm happy to help you with this. Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, the most appropriate sense of the word "combination" in this case would be:

Sense Number: 4 - a group of people (often temporary) having a common purpose.

In the given sentence, the author is referring to the demographic makeup of the homeless population, which consists of women and children, and how they are affected by various social issues such as drug, alcohol, and mental health problems. Therefore, the sense of "combination" related to a group of people with a common purpose fits best in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the best sense of "problem" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 – Definition: a state of difficulty that needs to be resolved

In this passage, the author is listing various factors that contribute to homelessness, including economic conditions, social issues, and personal struggles. The term "problem" is used consistently throughout the passage to refer to these different aspects of homelessness as sources of difficulty that need to be addressed. For instance, the author states, "a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending," indicating that they view homelessness as a result of specific policy decisions rather than a simple individual issue. Therefore, the first definition of "problem" – a state of difficulty that needs to be resolved – seems like the most suitable choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the verb "create" in this passage is:

Sense Number: 2 - bring into existence

The phrase "It is the gradual unfolding and deepening of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery story" suggests that the author is using "create" to mean bring something into being or existence. This sense aligns with the definition provided for sense number 2, where "create" refers to bringing something into existence, such as a new idea, concept, or situation.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the provided senses of the ambiguous word "result," I would choose Sense Number 3: "come about or follow as a consequence."

The context provides several factors that suggest this sense of "result" is the most appropriate choice. For instance, the phrase "nothing will result from this meeting" implies that no outcome or consequence will occur as a direct result of the meeting itself. Additionally, the mention of "cutbacks in social welfare spending" and "decay of the traditional nuclear family" suggests that there are underlying societal issues contributing to the problem of homelessness, rather than a specific event or action leading directly to it.

Therefore, I conclude that the best sense of "result" in the given context is Sense Number 3: "come about or follow as a consequence."

Here is my answer in the requested format:

"Sense Number: 3"
Response: Based on the given context, I would say that the best interpretation of the verb "connect" in this passage is sense number 2: make a logical or causal connection.

The passage highlights various ways in which homelessness can be understood, including as a housing problem, an employment problem, etc., and Dr. Wright makes connections between these different aspects of homelessness. Therefore, the sense of "connect" that involves making logical or causal links fits well with the context.

Here is my answer:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the three possible senses of the word "person," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: a human being

The context of the passage highlights the various aspects of homelessness as a complex issue affecting different groups of people, including individuals. Therefore, it makes more sense to interpret "person" as referring to individual humans rather than a specific gender or role.

Here are some reasons why I arrived at this conclusion:

* The phrase "Dr. Wright said" implies that there is a single speaker who is providing information, which aligns with the first sense of "person."
* The term "homelessness" itself refers to a state of being without permanent housing, which can be applied to any individual regardless of their identity.
* The examples provided in the passage do not suggest a specific referent, such as a particular profession or relationship, that would warrant one of the other senses.

Overall, the first sense of "person" seems like the best fit for the context, so I would choose option A.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'live' is:

    Sense Number: 2 - lead a certain kind of life; live in a certain style

The example sentence provided in the context supports this sense, as it describes various aspects of Dr. Wright's argument related to how homelessness is a complex issue that involves multiple factors, including the way people live their lives. Therefore, the sense of 'live' that refers to leading a particular lifestyle or manner of living is the most suitable fit for the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the word "quote" in this case is:

Sense Number: 3 – Refer to for illustration or proof

The sentence "If you 're homeless , you do n't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered ." implies that the speaker is using the term "quote" to refer to something they have heard or read before, rather than repeating it themselves. This aligns with the definition of sense number 3, which refers to referring to something for illustration or proof.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information about the different senses of the word 'director', I would choose sense number 2 as the most appropriate interpretation.

The sentence "If you're homeless, you don't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered" clearly implies that the speaker is referring to a person who has some kind of leadership role or authority, rather than a person who works in filmmaking or music direction. Additionally, the mention of a "board of directors" in the definition of sense number 2 aligns well with the organizational structure implied in the sentence.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I would suggest that the most appropriate sense of "center" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2

The phrase "the piece of ground in the outfield directly ahead of the catcher" clearly refers to the sport of baseball, where the center fielder is a defensive position located near the center of the outfield.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "sleep," I would choose Sense Number 1: Definition: be asleep.

Here's why: In the context of the quotation provided, it makes more sense that the speaker is referring to the act of being asleep rather than the ability to accommodate someone else's sleep. The mention of being robbed or murdered also supports this interpretation, as these crimes are more likely to occur when someone is unconscious or unable to defend themselves. Additionally, the use of the phrase "If you 're homeless" suggests that the speaker is addressing a specific group of people who may be at risk of violence while sleeping. Overall, the meaning of "sleep" in this context aligns better with Sense Number 1.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "rob" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: take something away by force or without the consent of the owner

The context of the quote from the director of the drop-in center for the homeless highlights the first definition of "rob," which refers to taking something away without the consent of the owner. In this case, the speaker is using the term to describe the fear of being robbed or murdered while homeless, indicating that they are referring to the act of taking something away without permission.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "fend" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Definition: withstand the force of something; Example: The trees resisted her.

In this context, the author is describing someone who is struggling to cope with the consequences of sleep deprivation, and the word "resisted" implies a strong and determined effort to withstand the negative effects. While the other sense ("try to manage without help") could also potentially apply depending on how one interprets the phrase "without psychiatric treatment," the second sense seems more fitting given the language used in the passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "have" is:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: have or possess, either in a concrete or an abstract sense

In the context of the passage, the author is discussing the situation of some homeless people having pre-existing mental illness or addiction. Therefore, sense 1, which refers to having or possessing something in a concrete or abstract sense, is the best fit.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "addiction," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1 - Being abnormally tolerant to and dependent on something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming (especially alcohol or narcotic drugs)

The context of the sentence you provided ("Some of the homeless , obviously , had pre-existing mental illness or addiction") supports this choice because it implies that the speaker is referring to a physical or psychological dependence on something, which aligns with the definition of sense 1. Additionally, there are no examples provided for senses 2 or 3, which further supports selecting sense 1 as the best fit for the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I believe the best sense of the word "fall" in this passage is:

Sense Number: 2 - move downward and lower, but not necessarily all the way

The sentence "Many others have fallen through the cracks in the economy into the grim, brutal world of our city streets." suggests that the word "fall" means moving downward and lower, but not necessarily all the way, as the phrase "through the cracks" implies a gradual descent rather than a sudden one.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "dismiss," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 – Cease to consider; put out of judicial consideration

In this context, the author seems to be arguing against the idea that reducing federal housing assistance programs caused an increase in homelessness during the Reagan-Bush administration. By using the phrase "dismiss" in this way, the author is suggesting that they do not accept this argument and instead believe that other factors were responsible for the increase in homelessness. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the meaning of the word in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word "view" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Definition: the visual percept of a region

In this sentence, the author is discussing the impact of reduced federal housing assistance programs on the homeless population in their city, and mentions that there were more people sleeping on the streets during the Reagan-Bush era. The use of the word "view" here implies a broader perspective or visual understanding of the situation, rather than any specific personal opinion or belief. Therefore, sense number 2 is the most relevant and accurate interpretation of the word in this context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "reduction," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 2

Definition: Any process in which electrons are added to an atom or ion (as by removing oxygen or adding hydrogen); always occurs accompanied by oxidation of the reducing agent."

This definition matches the context of the sentence provided, where the author mentions the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs, which could be interpreted as referring to a process of electron addition in chemistry. Additionally, the frequency count for this sense (8) is higher than the other two senses (4 and 2), further supporting its selection.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context you provided best matches sense number 2, "act or have an effect in a specified way or with a specific effect or outcome." The phrase "play a role" implies acting in a specific capacity or having an impact in a particular way, which aligns with this sense of the word.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word "role," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 4

In this context, the word "role" refers to the normal or customary activity of a person in a particular social setting. The passage mentions the reduced federal housing assistance programs leading to an increase in people sleeping on the streets, which suggests that the author is discussing the societal norms or expectations surrounding homelessness. Therefore, the fourth sense of "role" fits best in this context.
Response: 
"Sense Number: 2"

The context of the sentence suggests that the word "number" refers to a concept of quantity involving zero and units. The sentence mentions the reduction of federal housing assistance programs by 77%, which implies a numerical change or variation. Therefore, sense number 2 best fits the context given.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "woman" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: an adult female person (as opposed to a man)

The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is referring to an individual woman, rather than a specific female person in relation to another person. Additionally, the examples provided in the possible senses support this interpretation, as they all refer to the woman as an independent entity. Therefore, the first definition best fits the meaning of the term in this sentence.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "bother," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - Cause annoyance in; disturb, especially by minor irritations.

The sentence "There is no sign that you bothered to consider the inverse of your logic" implies that someone is criticizing another person for not thinking through the implications of their argument, which aligns with the second definition of "bother." The phrase "cause annoyance in" fits well with the idea of criticizing someone's lack of consideration. Additionally, the example provided ("For instance, the following statement was rated low in compulsivity, `She's naturally quite neat about things, but it doesn't bother her at all if her room gets messy.'") also supports this interpretation as it shows how someone could be both tidy and unbothered by messiness.
Response: 
"Sense Number: 2"

The context of the sentence provides evidence for sense number 2, "give careful consideration to." The phrase "no sign that you bothered to consider" implies that the speaker expects the subject to have given thoughtful attention to the issue of mental illness and substance abuse being causes of homelessness, rather than simply dismissing them without proper examination. This usage aligns with the definition of sense number 2, where "consider" means to give careful thought or deliberation to something. According to the provided corpus data, this sense of "consider" occurs relatively frequently in written English, indicating its commonality in everyday language use.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word 'research', I would choose Sense Number 2: Definition - a search for knowledge.

Here's why: The context of the sentence mentions making a convenient assertion, which implies that the speaker wants to find evidence or data to support their claim. This aligns better with the definition of 'research' as a search for knowledge. Additionally, the example sentence provided in this sense highlights how the term is often used in academic settings, where scholars seek to uncover new insights or understandings through rigorous inquiry.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of the verb "stop" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Put an end to a state or an activity.

This sense of "stop" fits best in the context of your sentence because it implies bringing an action or process to a halt.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the best interpretation of the word "assertion" in the sentence is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided for this sense fits well with the meaning of the sentence. The speaker is suggesting that a claim or statement was made without providing sufficient evidence to support it, which aligns with the idea of making an assertion emphatically without needing any proof.
Response: 
Sense Number: 1
The word “make” in the given sentence can be interpreted as “engage in”.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "march" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - the act of marching; walking with regular steps (especially in a procession of some kind)

This definition fits well with the context provided, where the author is describing the organizers of a march as "self-serving groups that `know a good thing when they see it,'" and mentioning the "military regulations" and "parade ground." It seems likely that the author is using the term "march" to refer to the act of organizing and participating in a procession or parade, rather than any other sense of the word.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the three possible senses of the verb "choose," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - Select as an alternative over another.

In this context, the author is using "choose" to mean selecting one option over another, specifically citing two organizations as examples of groups that were selected for support. The phrase "know a good thing when they see it" also supports this interpretation, suggesting that the author is referring to a deliberate decision to support these particular groups rather than any other options.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best definition of "cite" in this instance is:

Sense Number: 1 - Make reference to

The author of the text is using "cite" to mean referring to specific examples or instances to illustrate a point or argument. In this case, the author is citing particular organizations as examples of those that may have motivations other than altruism for supporting the cause of the homeless.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "group," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 1"

The usage of "group" in the context suggests that the author is referring to a collection of individuals or entities working together, rather than a chemical compound or mathematical set. The mention of "profit-sharing money" and the comparison to a "union contract" further supports this interpretation, as unions typically consist of a group of workers who share financial resources and work together for mutual benefit. Therefore, sense number one best fits the meaning of "group" in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'insinuate' is:

"Sense Number: 2 - give to understand".

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense because the speaker is suggesting that the march received its support from organizations with ulterior motives, rather than being a genuine effort to help the homeless. The phrase "insinuated that..." implies a suggestion or hinting towards something, which aligns better with the definition of giving someone an understanding of something rather than introducing oneself into a situation.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2
The given sentence best fits sense number 2, "enter or assume a certain state or condition." The phrase "get involved" implies entering into a situation or condition, rather than physically moving towards a location. Additionally, the context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is referring to the march as an event that assumes a certain state or condition, rather than a physical movement.
Response: Support in the context given seems to have multiple meanings depending on how we interpret the words used. Here are my thoughts on each of them:

Support Number: 1 
The text talks about the National Association of Homebuilders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen getting their major support from self-serving groups. Given these two organizations are related to building construction, it makes sense that the author uses the definition of "support" meaning provision of material aid or financial help. Therefore, sense number 1 fits well here.

Support Number: 2
The term "support" is also used in the phrase "aiding the cause or policy or interests." It implies giving moral backing or encouragement to someone. In this case, the author accuses certain groups of using the march for the homeless for personal gain, implying they do not genuinely care about helping the needy but only want to advance their business agendas. So sense number 2 works well too!

Support Number: 3
The term "support" is employed regarding offering non-materialistic help. When the writer states that what kind of action may get public support, it shows that they are looking beyond monetary contributions. Instead, they are interested in gathering social proof or emotional buy-ins. Thus sense three suits perfectly.

Support Number: 4
In this instance, the word "support" refers to direct military aid like troops, equipment, or supplies. The author argues that President Kennedy has been working tirelessly to garner bipartisan support for his moves towards Cuba and Laos. Considering this detail, sense number four aligns better than others.

Support Number: 5
While the word "documentary evidence" does contain the root word "support," it doesn't fit within the context. So let's move ahead without considering this option further.

Support Number: 6
It is clear that the author intends to convey the notion of financial backbone when talking about "support". They claim that someone spent eight hundred dollars to provide financial assistance. Consequently, sense number six is more suitable here.

Support Number: 7
This usage of "support" relates to structures designed to hold heavy loads or weights. Although mentioning the debris scattered across several areas, including wire cages for mice, microscopes, and un
Response: 
"Sense Number: 1"

The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is using the sense of "know" that means "be cognizant or aware of a fact or a specific piece of information." The speaker is accusing certain groups of exploiting the situation for their own gain, which aligns with the definition of this sense of "know."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word "thing" is sense number 1:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: a special situation
Example: He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .

In this context, the speaker is using "things" to refer to a particular set of circumstances or conditions, rather than referring to a physical object or artifact.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word "see" is:

Sense Number: 2
Definition: perceive (an idea or situation) mentally

Explanation: In the given context, the speaker seems to be using "see" to indicate that they are mentally processing or imagining the idea of the march being motivated by greed or the profit motive. The usage aligns with definition 2 of "see," which refers to perceiving an idea or situation mentally.
Response: Sure! I can help you determine the most appropriate sense of the word 'crusade' in the given context. After analyzing the information provided, I believe the most suitable sense is:

Sense Number: 1

Additionally, the phrase "knight of the range" refers to someone fighting for a cause, further supporting this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "base" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Situate as a center of operations.

The sentence "we will base this project in the new lab" implies that the project will be located or operated from within the new laboratory, rather than being founded on any particular principle or idea. This sense of "base" fits well with the overall meaning of the passage, which is focused on the location and organization of the march for the homeless.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "force", I believe the most appropriate sense in this case is:

The examples provided for this sense also align with the context, as they relate to scientific concepts such as magnetism and the behavior of physical systems.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "subscribe," I believe the most appropriate sense in this case is:

The context of the sentence "But isn't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to, and advertise in, your paper?" suggests that the speaker is using the verb "subscribe" in its fourth sense, meaning "pay (an amount of money) as a contribution to a charity or service, especially at regular intervals." This sense is supported by the mention of "advertising in" the paper, which implies a regular payment or subscription fee.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "advertise," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - Make publicity for; try to sell (a product)

This fits best with the second definition of "participate," which means to become a participant or be involved in something.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose Sense Number 1 as the most appropriate definition of "homeless". Here's why:

"Sense Number: 1"

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence that the speaker is referring to individuals who lack permanent housing. The phrase "underwent psychiatric examinations" implies that these individuals were being evaluated for mental health issues related to their living situation. Additionally, the mention of a person being found murdered in Central Park further supports this interpretation, as it is unlikely that a person without a fixed address could be killed in such a location. Therefore, the most likely meaning of "homeless" in this context is someone unfortunate without housing.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the best sense of "undergo" in this case is:

In this scenario, the speaker is considering these individuals as part of a larger group of people who will be affected by the action of putting them out on the streets. Therefore, the best fit for the sense of 'include' in this context is definition two.

Here is my answer in the requested format:

"Sense Number: 2"

Therefore, sense number 2 best fits the meaning of the word "find" in this particular context.

Additionally, the reference to "sticky fingers and sweaty scammers" suggests a literary or creative work rather than a physical object.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best sense of the verb "lead" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Have as a result or residue

The sentence "Mr. Sternberg and his co-author , Matthew C. Harrison Jr. , lead us along the path Wedtech traveled..." implies that they are guiding or directing the reader through the story of Wedtech's journey, highlighting the consequences or results of their actions. Therefore, sense 2, which refers to having as a result or residue, is the most suitable choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "path" is:

Sense Number: 2 - Definition: a way especially designed for a particular use.

The sentence "Mr. Sternberg and his co-author, Matthew C. Harrison Jr., lead us along the path Wedtech traveled..." implies that "path" refers to a specific way or route that Wedtech took, rather than just any general path. Additionally, the mention of "grape-arbors" and "fruit trees" in the surrounding text suggests that the path being referred to is one that has been deliberately created or designated for a particular purpose.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "travel" in this case is:

    Sense Number: 2 (Undertake a journey or trip)

The sentence "Mr. Sternberg and his co-author, Matthew C. Harrison Jr., lead us along the path Wedtech traveled..." implies that the speaker is referring to a specific journey or trip taken by these individuals, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. Additionally, the mention of "path" and "journey" suggest a physical movement from one location to another, further supporting this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word "company" is:

    Sense Number: 2

The definition of this sense matches the usage in the given context: "With our company of soldiers, we made one long column of reddish dust." This sense refers to a small military unit, typically consisting of two or three platoons.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "contractor" is:

Sense Number: 1 - someone (person or firm) who contracts to build things

This definition matches the context provided, where "contractor" refers to a company that was involved in building and developing various products and services for the military and government agencies. The example provided also supports this sense, as it mentions the American contractor who spurned an escort, suggesting that they were a person or organization involved in construction or contracting work.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 2: "put into the care or protection of someone".

The context of the sentence "From its inception as a small manufacturing company to the status of full-fledged defense contractor, entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy" suggests that the author is using the verb "entrust" to mean "put into the care or protection of someone". This makes sense because the company was entrusted with the responsibility of producing important equipment for the military, implying that it was placed under their care and protection.

According to the information provided, this sense of "entrust" occurs 6 times in a large corpus of texts, indicating that it is a relatively common usage of the word. Here is an example sentence illustrating this sense:

Sense Number: 2

Definition: Put into the care or protection of someone

Example: He left the decision to his deputy.
Response: Sure! I'm happy to help you determine the meaning of the word "produce" in the given context. After analyzing the possible senses provided, I believe the most appropriate sense for the word "produce" in the context of the paragraph is:

Sense Number: 2 - Create or manufacture a man-made product.

The context of the paragraph suggests that the author is referring to the creation or manufacture of something tangible, specifically mentioning the production of equipment for the Army and Navy. This sense of "produce" aligns with the idea of creating or making something new, rather than bringing forth or yielding something existing.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "book" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided for sense number 1 fits well with the context of the sentence, where the author refers to "the book" as a written work or composition that has been published. The mention of the book's title and the quote from the novel further support this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 2: Definition- move around in a circular motion.

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "become" is:

Sense Number: 2 – Undergo a change or development.

In the given context, the phrase "soon after Wedtech's creation" implies that something happened after the company was created, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. Specifically, the text suggests that Fred Neuberger became John Mariotta's partner after the company's creation, indicating that he joined the company at some point subsequent to its founding. Therefore, the best choice among the available options is sense 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about the different senses of the word "partner," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2

In this context, "partner" refers to an associate in an activity or endeavor or sphere of common interest. The phrase "soon after Wedtech's creation" implies that the partner mentioned in the text, Fred Neuberger, became involved with the company after its founding. Therefore, sense 2 best fits the meaning of "partner" in this sentence.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "start" is sense number 2: "set in motion, cause to start".

The sentence "Although started in 1965..." suggests that the word "started" is being used as a verb, indicating that something began or was caused to begin. This fits well with the definition of sense number 2, where the word "start" means to set something in motion or to cause it to begin.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: 
Sense Number: 1
The word "get" in the given context most likely means "come into the possession of something concrete or abstract".
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word "roll" in the sentence is sense number 2: "move along on or as if on wheels or a wheeled vehicle".

Here's why: In the sentence, "we rolled over a paved road", it seems that the speaker is using "roll" to mean moving along on some kind of vehicle, such as a wheel or a car. This sense of "roll" is consistent with the definition provided in sense number 2, where it means moving along on or as if on wheels or a wheeled vehicle.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides evidence for sense number 2 of "discover", which means to learn about something accidentally or unexpectedly. The sentence mentions Mr. Neuberger discovering the federal government's Section 8 A minority business program in 1975, which suggests that he became aware of this program suddenly or unexpectedly, rather than through deliberate searching or investigation.
Response: Sure! I'd be happy to help with WSD. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "programme", my answer would be:

"Sense Number: 3"

The context of the passage mentions the word "programme" in relation to a radio or television show, which aligns with definition #3. The phrase "did you see his program last night?" suggests that the speaker is referring to a specific broadcast or episode of a TV show, which supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "creation", I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 2 (an artifact that has been brought into existence by someone)"

The sentence you provided suggests that the word "creation" refers to an artifact or thing that has been created or made by someone, rather than referring to the act of creating something or the event of something being created. This aligns with the definition and example provided for sense number 2.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'mandate', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - Make mandatory

In the given context, the phrase "Great Society creation" implies that we are talking about a policy or law that has been enacted by the government, which aligns with the definition of 'mandate' as making something mandatory. Additionally, the example provided ("the new director of the school board mandated regular tests") further supports this interpretation. Therefore, out of the three possible senses listed, sense number 2 seems the most relevant in this case.
Response: Sure! I can help with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "contract," the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense of "contract" aligns well with the context of the sentence: "a binding agreement between two or more persons that is enforceable by law." The mention of a "union contract" in the context also supports this interpretation. Additionally, the other senses do not fit quite as neatly into the context, with sense 2 referring to a specific type of card game and sense 3 being undefined.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "award" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Give as judged due or on the basis of merit.

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense because it mentions "certain government contracts being awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses." Noncompetitive awards typically involve selecting a winner based on criteria other than a formal bidding process, such as merit or qualifications. Therefore, the sense of "award" in this context refers to giving something (in this case, government contracts) as judged due or on the basis of merit rather than through a competitive process.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "realize" is sense number 1:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: be fully aware or cognizant of
Example: Mr. Neuberger realized that, although of Italian ancestry, Mr. Mariotta still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in Puerto Rico.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best sense of the word "qualify" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The usage of "qualify" in the context suggests that Mr. Neuberger is trying to determine if Mr. Mariotta meets certain requirements or criteria to be considered a minority person. Therefore, the first sense of "qualify," which means "prove capable or fit; meet requirements," is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "partner" is:

Sense Number: 2 - an associate in an activity or endeavor or sphere of common interest

In this context, the term "partner" refers to someone with whom another person is associated in some activity or endeavor, such as business or social activities. The example provided supports this interpretation, as it describes how Madden labels a young man as a potential political candidate, suggesting that they are associates in a particular field of interest.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of "have" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: have or possess, either in a concrete or an abstract sense

In this context, "have" can be interpreted as meaning "possess" or "own," which fits with the idea of falsifying the true ownership of a corporation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "falsify," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - tamper, with the purpose of deception

In this context, the phrase "merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation" implies that someone is deliberately altering or manipulating information to deceive others. Therefore, sense 2, which refers to tampering with the purpose of deception, seems like the best fit.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "ownership" is:

Sense Number: 2 – the act of having and controlling property.

In this context, the sentence "the two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation" suggests that someone is trying to deceive or mislead others about who actually owns the corporation. Therefore, the sense of "ownership" that relates to the act of having and controlling property is the most relevant here.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'become', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 – Undergo a change or development

The context of the sentence "On paper only, two-thirds Mariotta, one-third Neuberger, and they were in the program and off to the races" suggests that the word 'become' means to undergo a change or development, specifically related to something being planned or implemented. The mention of "paper only" implies that the plan is not yet fully realized, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. Additionally, the example sentence provided supports this interpretation as it mentions the program being developed and implemented.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the available information, I would say that the best sense of the verb "locate" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Determine or indicate the place, site, or limits of, as if by an instrument or by a survey.

This definition matches the context provided, where the author mentions that the company Wedtech was located in the South Bronx, which implies that someone determined or indicated the location of the company using some kind of instrument or survey. The other senses do not seem to fit quite as well in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "area" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - a subject of study

The context mentions the location of Wedtech in the South Bronx, which is a well-known neighborhood in New York City. Given that the context does not suggest any specific reference to geography, culture, or people, it seems unlikely that the word "area" refers to one of those meanings. Instead, the mention of "areas" in the context implies that the speaker is referring to different subjects or fields of study, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), which is consistent with the definition of sense number 2.
Response: 
Sense Number: 1
The word "make" in the given context most likely means "engage in".
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word "company" is:

Sense Number: 2

This sense of "company" refers to a small military unit, typically consisting of two or three platoons. The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is referring to a group of people working together in a military capacity.
Response: Sure! I can assist you with identifying the correct sense of the ambigious term 'rebuild'.

Based on the given context, I would choose sense number one as the best fit:

"Sense Number: 1 - Build Again."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best sense of "keep" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Continue a certain state, condition, or activity.

In this sentence, "keep" implies continuing to use the minority – South Bronx angle throughout the Reagan '80s, indicating that the speaker is referring to the company's consistent focus on this particular aspect of its operations.
Response: Sure! I will help you with identifying the correct sense of the ambiguous word "use" in the given context.

After analyzing the possible senses of "use" and considering the context, I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 – take or consume (regularly or habitually)

In the given sentence, "the company plugged itself right into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx and kept using the minority — South Bronx angle through the Reagan '80s," there is a repetition of the term "using" which suggests that the speaker is referring to the second definition of "use." The phrase "kept using" implies a regular or habitual action, further supporting this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "angle" is:

Sense Number: 2

In this context, "angle" seems to refer to a biased way of looking at or presenting something, which aligns well with the definition provided for this sense. The phrase "a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff" suggests that there is a particular perspective or approach being taken that may not be entirely objective or unbiased.
Response: 
"Sense Number: 2"

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for the second sense of "start," which means "set in motion, cause to start." This sense is supported by the phrase "To secure precise measurements of these frequencies," which implies that something needs to be initiated or triggered in order to collect data. Additionally, the mention of a research program being "started" further reinforces this meaning. Therefore, the best interpretation of the ambiguous word "start" in this context is sense number 2.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence suggests that the word "serve" means "do duty or hold offices; serve in a specific function." In this context, the sentence implies that the person being referred to has a position of authority or responsibility within a government agency or organization, and is fulfilling their duties accordingly. The mention of replacing a full-time doctor with a part-time doctor or one who serves on a fee per case basis only further supports this interpretation. Therefore, sense number 2 best fits the given context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "sentence" is:

Sense Number: 2 – (criminal law) a final judgment of guilty in a criminal case and the punishment that is imposed.

In this context, the term "sentence" refers to a legal penalty or punishment, which fits well with the mention of "a final judgment of guilty" and "impose[d] punishment." The other two senses mentioned do not seem as relevant or fitting in this particular passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "company" in this passage is:

Sense Number: 2 – Small military unit; usually two or three platoons.

The context mentions "a company of soldiers," which implies that the word refers to a group of troops or military personnel, rather than any other meaning mentioned in the options.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "begin," my answer is:

"Sense Number: 1"

The sentence "The company began a career of bribing federal, state, and local public officials..." implies that the word "begin" means "take the first step or steps in carrying out an action." This sense is supported by the fact that the sentence describes the company starting a career of something, which fits best with definition 1.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "career" in the given passage is:

Sense Number: 2 – the general progression of your working or professional life.

In this passage, the author mentions several individuals who have had notable careers in various fields, including politics and literature. The term "career" is used to describe the general trajectory of their professional lives, rather than a specific job or occupation. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the meaning of the word in this context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'bribe' is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for this sense matches the context perfectly. In the given passage, it seems that someone is accused of making illegal payments to influential people in exchange for favorable treatment. Therefore, option 1, which defines 'bribe' as making illegal payments to obtain favors or influence, is the best fit.
Response: Sure! I can help you determine the most appropriate sense of the word "official" in the given context. After analyzing the information provided, I conclude that the most suitable sense of "official" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - someone who administers the rules of a game or sport.

The example sentence provided ("Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players, coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football.") clearly shows that the term "official" is being used to refer to individuals involved in managing or governing a sports team. The fact that the sentence mentions receiving an "official city citation" further supports this interpretation, as it implies that these individuals hold positions of authority within their organization.

Therefore, based on the context and the available information, I recommend selecting sense number 2 as the best fit for the word "official" in this passage.
Response: Sure! I can help you determine the most appropriate sense of the word "include" in the given context.

After analyzing the context and the possible senses provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of "include" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Consider as part of something

The context of the sentence provides evidence that "include" means considering someone or something as part of a larger group or category. For instance, the phrase "spread over an area no larger than Oregon" highlights the idea of comparing different groups or areas, while the mention of people being different from each other supports the notion of considering them part of a broader category. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the meaning of "include" in this situation.
Response: Sure! I will assist with your request. Based on the given context, I believe the best definition fits as follows:

"Sense Number: 4"

In this case, "use" means "seek or achieve an end by using to one's advantage." This meaning aligns well with the statement "Wedtech didn't just use old-fashioned bribery," as it implies using unconventional methods to gain an advantage.
Response: 
Sense Number: 1
The given word "make" in the context of the passage refers to the verb "engage in".
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the word "use" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2

The definition of this sense fits best with the context provided, as it refers to the purpose or function of something. In this case, the word "use" is being used to describe the reason why someone is writing a letter to their sister, which aligns with the definition of this sense.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the verb "retain" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Allow to remain in a place or position or maintain a property or feature

The context describes how certain individuals were allowed to remain in their positions or roles, such as Brian Thayer being retained in his present capacity as administrator of the fund, despite the increase in responsibilities. This sense of "retain" aligns well with the usage in the given sentence.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "include" is:

Sense Number: 2 - Consider as part of something.

In the given context, the phrase "including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofziger" suggests that the author is referring to a group of people or entities that are being considered as part of something bigger. Therefore, sense 2 best fits the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "seek," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 – Try to locate or discover, or try to establish the existence of.

The context of the sentence "When necessary, it sought and received assistance from organized crime" implies that the word "seek" means trying to locate or discover something, rather than making an effort or attempting to do something. Additionally, the examples provided in the other senses do not fit well with the given context. For instance, sense number 1 does not seem relevant since there is no indication of Mrs. Meeker being ready to seek advice; sense number 3 does not fit since there is no mention of finding the law; and sense number 4 does not apply since there is no suggestion of a liquid seeking its own level. Therefore, the second sense seems like the best option.
Response: 
Sense Number: 1

The context of the sentence "When necessary, it sought and received assistance from organized crime" suggests that the most appropriate sense of "receive" in this case is definition 1: "get something; come into possession of". This sense is supported by the fact that the phrase "assistance from organized crime" implies that something (i.e., help or support) is being obtained or acquired. Therefore, the best fit among the given options is sense 1.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "assistance," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - Definition: a resource; Example: They supplemented their income by small government assistance, by tutoring and economizing wherever they could.

In this context, the word "assistance" refers to financial aid or support, which aligns with the second definition provided. The phrase "when necessary, it sought and received assistance from organized crime" implies that the entity receiving help is dependent on external resources to meet its needs, which fits best with the meaning of "a resource."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'become', I would choose sense number 2: Undergo a change or development.

The sentence "Sometimes the bribed became partners in the company" implies that something changed or developed, specifically the relationship between the parties involved. This sense of 'become' fits best with the context as it describes a transformation or evolution from one state to another.

Here is the breakdown of each sense number along with its definition, frequency, and example sentence:

* Sense Number: 2 - Undergo a change or development
	+ Definition: Change or develop something, often in a specific way or to a particular degree.
	+ Frequency: Medium (appears 50-99 times in the corpus)
	+ Example Sentence: Have you permitted it to become a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee morale and, consequently, increased productivity?
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "partner" is:

Sense Number: 2 - an associate in an activity or endeavor or sphere of common interest.

In this context, the phrase "the partners" refers to individuals involved in a particular business venture or project, rather than referring to spouses or married couples. Therefore, sense 2 best fits the meaning of the text.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "management" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Those in charge of running a business.

The context provides evidence for this sense because it mentions "the merit system," which typically refers to a way of evaluating and rewarding employees within an organization. Therefore, it makes sense that the word "management" would refer to those in charge of running the organization or business.

Here's why I don't think sense number 1 is the best fit: While the definition of "management" in sense number 1 does relate to the idea of overseeing or directing something, the example given doesn't seem to support this meaning. Instead, it seems to be describing someone who is struggling to find time to pursue their own interests due to their responsibilities at work.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context given, the most appropriate sense of the ambigious word 'use' is:

"Sense Number: 2"

The sentence "Wedtech management used the merit system." suggests that the word 'use' means 'take or consume (regularly or habitually)'. This sense is supported by the definition and example provided for sense number 2, as well as the fact that the word 'management' implies a regular or habitual action.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence "Wedtech management used the merit system" suggests that the word "system" in this instance refers to a group of independent but interrelated elements that make up a unified whole. This definition aligns with the second sense of the word "system," where it refers to a collection of things that are connected together to form a coherent entity. In this case, Wedtech management likely used a system of managing employee performance using the merit system, where employees are evaluated and rewarded based on their individual performance within the larger organizational framework.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best fit for the sense of "receive" is:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: get something; come into possession of

The sentence "If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag, but equity." implies that the speaker is referring to someone receiving something tangible or valuable in return for their actions, which aligns with the first definition of "receive".
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'equity' is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for this sense matches the context perfectly. The passage mentions the impact of a divestiture order on the market value of stocks, including General Motors and DuPont, which supports the interpretation of 'equity' as the difference between the market value of a property and the claims held against it. Additionally, the mention of shareholder ownership interests does not seem relevant to the context, and the third sense, conformity with rules or standards, is not mentioned at all. Therefore, option 1 is the best fit.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would choose sense number 2: "discover or determine the existence, presence, or fact of."

The phrase "you found yourself out in the cold" implies that someone was unexpectedly left without support or resources, which fits best with the meaning of discovering or determining the existence of something unwanted or unplanned. Additionally, the mention of Mr. Mariotta being a "semiliterate `minority` person" suggests that the writer is highlighting his lack of education or status, which aligns with the idea of discovering or determining something unknown or hidden.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the available information, I would say that the best sense of "fate" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - The ultimate agency regarded as predetermining the course of events (often personified as a woman)

In the given context, the phrase "the firm's semiliterate `minority` person" suggests that there is some kind of power dynamic at play, where one group has authority over another. The mention of "Fate" in this context implies that the outcome of events is already determined, and that the speaker believes that the decision-making process is being guided by a higher power beyond their control. Therefore, sense #2 seems like the most fitting choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and senses provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "befall" in this situation is:

Sense Number: 2 – Happen, occur, or be the case in the course of events or by chance; (Santayana)

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense as it mentions something happening to someone ("you") and occurring ("eventually") to another person ("Mr. Mariotta"). Additionally, the phrase "in the course of events" implies a natural progression of events rather than any deliberate action taken by the subject.
Response: Sure! I can help with that. Based on the context provided, the best sense of the ambiguous word "person" is:

Sense Number: 2 – Definition: a human body (usually including the clothing)

In the given sentence, the phrase "a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta," implies that someone (Mr. Mariotta) has met an unfortunate end, which is more consistent with the meaning of "person" as a human body rather than a individual or a grammatical category. Additionally, the mention of hiding a weapon on someone's "person" further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the available information, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word 'fall short' in the sentence is...

Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for sense number 1 fits well with the context of the sentence. The author seems to be implying that the book 'Feeding Frenzy' did not meet their expectations of being a gripping read, which aligns with the first sense of 'fall short'. Additionally, the example sentence provided supports this interpretation as it mentions the book falling short of being truly engaging.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides the best fit for sense number 2 of "show," which means "establish the validity of something, as by an example, explanation or experiment." In the sentence, the phrase " None of the scams show much ingenuity" implies that none of the fraudulent activities presented demonstrate any originality or creativity, which aligns with the definition of sense number 2. Additionally, the examples provided for this sense illustrate how it can be used to convey the idea of demonstrating or proving something, such as the PM showing that they were not involved in a crime or Reading the Old Testament showing that an idea was abhorrent to a particular group of people.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "ingenuity" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - The property of being ingenious

The sentence "Auditors found crookery the first day on the job" suggests that something fishy or illegal was discovered early on in the auditing process, which aligns with the definition of "ingenuity" as the property of being clever or resourceful in devising cunning plans or schemes. Therefore, it makes more sense that the speaker is using the word "ingenuity" to describe the auditors' ability to uncover the fraudulent activities rather than their creative imagination.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would choose sense number 4, "establish after a calculation, investigation, experiment, survey, or study."

The sentence "You may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible," suggests that the speaker is using the term "find" to mean establish or determine something through research or analysis. This sense of the word fits best in the context of auditing and financial investigations, which involves calculating, investigating, and studying financial data to reach conclusions or make recommendations. Therefore, sense number 4 is the most appropriate choice for the given sentence.

So, my response would be:

"Sense Number: 4"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "bribe" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided fits well with the context of the sentence, where someone is accused of making illegal payments to shut up Wedtech's scammers. The fact that the word "bribe" is used in conjunction with the phrase "to shut up" also supports this interpretation, as it implies that the payment was made to silence or quiet someone.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of "shut_up" in this case is:

Sense Number: 3

The sentence "Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up " implies that someone is trying to silence or quiet someone else, which aligns with the definition of "cause to be quiet or not talk". Therefore, sense number 3 is the best fit for the given context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "want," I would choose sense number 2, which defines "want" as "have need of."

Here's why: In the given context, the author describes the scammers as "conspicuous consumers" who want material possessions such as big houses, Mercedes cars, and beautiful women. The phrase "wanted big houses" implies that these individuals had a need or requirement for these items, rather than simply desiring them out of personal preference. Therefore, sense number 2 best fits the context and meaning of the word "want" in this passage.

So, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "clothes," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: clothing in general

This sense makes the most sense in the context of the passage because it refers to the speaker's observation of the scammers' appearance, which includes their clothing choices. The phrase "expensive clothes" specifically highlights the luxury items they wore, further supporting this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "wrestle" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - engage in deep thought, consideration, or debate

The context of the sentence suggests that none of the people mentioned are engaged in any physical activity such as wrestling, but rather they are grappling with complex ideas or emotions. Therefore, the second sense of "wrestle", which refers to engaging in deep thought or consideration, seems like the best fit.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context of the given passage clearly suggests that the speaker is referring to the second definition of "change" – "undergo a change; become different in essence; losing one's or its original nature."

In the passage, the speaker describes Dr. Irving Louis Lobsenz, a pediatrician who changed his name to Rusty Kent London and became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack, indicating that he underwent a significant change in his identity and profession. The phrase "when customs were rapidly changing" further supports this interpretation, suggesting that the speaker is referring to a broader cultural shift rather than a specific instance of personal change.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "name" in this passage is:

Sense Number: 2 – Reputation

In this sentence, the word "name" refers to a person's reputation, as the text mentions a group of people defending their company's reputation. This sense of the word is supported by the fact that the sentence specifically references the company's reputation being defended, rather than any other aspect of the word's meanings such as a language unit, family lineage, or a well-known person.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses of the ambiguous word 'become', I would choose sense number 2: "undergo a change or development".

Here's why: In the given context, the sentence mentions someone changing their name and becoming a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack. This implies that the person underwent a transformation or change from being a pediatrician to a different profession. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the meaning of the verb 'become' in this context.

Frequency count for sense number 2: 5

Example sentence: "Have you permitted it to become a giveaway program rather than one that has the goal of improved employee morale and, consequently, increased productivity?"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the best sense of the ambiguous word "author" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – someone who originates or causes or initiates something

Specifically, the sentence implies that the subject "gets" arrested towards the end of the story, indicating that they enter a state of being under arrest.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "arrest" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition given for this sense matches the meaning of the verb in the context of the sentence: "to take into custody." It makes sense that Heidi entered the story towards the end and got arrested just in time, as it implies that she was taken into custody by law enforcement.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word "absorb," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - Take up mentally

In the given context, the phrase "the authors gloss over" implies that the writers are not providing a detailed explanation or analysis of the root causes of Wedtech, instead choosing to focus on surface-level details. This fits best with the second definition of "absorb," which means to take something mentally or intellectually.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word 'author' in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - someone who originates or causes or initiates something

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense as it mentions the company Wedtech and its involvement in a scandal, which implies that there is someone responsible for causing or initiating these events. Additionally, the fact that the authors are glossing over the root causes of Wedtech suggests that they are trying to avoid directly addressing the person or people involved in the scandal. Therefore, the second sense of 'author', which refers to someone who originates or causes something, seems the most relevant and appropriate in this situation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided information, I would say that the best interpretation of "gloss over" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Cover up a misdemeanor, fault, or error.

The passage mentions "the root causes of Wedtech," which implies that there is something significant or problematic about it that needs to be addressed rather than simply being brushed aside or ignored. Additionally, the phrase "talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of Communism" suggests that the issue at hand is not just a minor mistake or oversight, but rather a serious matter that requires attention and consideration. Therefore, the second definition of "gloss over" as covering up a misdemeanor, fault, or error seems most fitting in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "program" in this sentence is:

Sense Number: 2

The sentence mentions the word "Feeding Frenzy," which suggests that the authors are referring to a specific project or initiative within a larger organization. Additionally, the phrase "under whose auspices" implies that the scandal being referred to is related to a particular government agency or department, which aligns better with sense 2's definition of a system of projects or services intended to meet a public need.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'scandal' in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - a disgraceful event

The context of the passage mentions "Section 8" which is a federal program, suggesting that the author is referring to a larger political or social issue rather than a personal one. Additionally, the phrase "the root causes of Wedtech" implies that there was a significant problem or controversy surrounding the organization, which aligns with the definition of a disgraceful event. Finally, the example sentence provided highlights the idea of a public disgrace or shame, further supporting the selection of this sense.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of "take_place" is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided fits perfectly with the context given. In the passage, the author mentions "the root causes of Wedtech," which refers to a specific event or issue that occurred in the past. Therefore, the sense of "take_place" that best fits here is "come to pass," which means to happen or occur as part of a sequence of events.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "come around" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Change one's position or opinion

The context of the sentence you provided suggests that the speaker is referring to a shift in perspective or attitude towards something, which aligns with the definition of sense 1. For instance, the phrase "they do at least come around to saying" implies that there was previously a different viewpoint, but now they are acknowledging a new perspective. Additionally, the mention of "rigid affirmative action programs" suggests a controversial issue where people may hold differing opinions, making sense 1 the most likely choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word 'say', I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate meaning.

"Sense Number: 1"

In this context, 'say' seems to mean 'express in words'. The sentence "They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end 'rigid affirmative action programs.'" implies that someone is expressing their thoughts or opinions about ending affirmative action programs using language. Therefore, sense number 1 best fits the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "court" is:

Sense Number: 1

The usage of the word "court" in the context suggests that the speaker is referring to a gathering of people, including judges, where judicial business is conducted. This matches the definition of the first sense of the word, which refers to an assembly of judges or other officials conducting judicial affairs.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "want" is:

Sense Number: 2 – Have Need Of

In this context, "want" means "have need of," which fits well with the idea of the court potentially ending "rigid affirmative action programs." The phrase "might want to end" implies that there is a possibility or likelihood that the court will act upon this desire or need.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "end," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number 2: Bring to an end or halt."

In this context, the speaker seems to be discussing whether society has grown too rapidly and could potentially end civilization. This sense of "end" aligns with the idea of bringing something to a stop or conclusion, rather than referring to the beginning or middle of something.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "program" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2

The context mentions "courts might want to end `rigid affirmative action programs.'" which aligns with the definition of "a system of projects or services intended to meet a public need." This sense of the word is also supported by the high frequency of its usage in a large corpus of texts, as well as the example provided, which refers to reviewing the objectives of a benefit and service program.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'leave' is:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: go away from a place

The sentence "Programs like Section 8 A are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up" supports this sense because it implies that something valuable is being left behind, suggesting that the speaker is using 'leave' in the sense of going away from a place.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "gold," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 2 - a deep yellow color."

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense because the author compares the value of something to the metal gold, implying that they are referring to its color rather than any other meaning of the word. Additionally, the examples provided for this sense match the language used in the context, such as "It was professedly worth three thousand dollars in stock and good will," which further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word "express" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – articulate; either verbally or with a cry, shout, or noise

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense because it implies that the speaker is criticizing someone for expressing their wishes in a loud or forceful manner. The phrase "drop dead" is often used idiomatically to mean "die," which fits with the sense of expressing something forcefully or emphatically.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would choose Sense Number 2: a sudden unexpected event.

The sentence "Section 8 A programs are like leaving gold in the street and expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up" implies that something unexpected has happened, which aligns with the definition of Sense 2. The mention of thieves walking by to steal something valuable also supports this interpretation. Therefore, the best fit for the ambiguous word 'surprise' in this context is Sense 2.

Here's my response in the requested format:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the verb "walk" in this case is:

The definition provided for this sense matches the meaning conveyed in the context: "use one's feet to advance; advance by steps." In the given sentence, the speaker is using the phrase "like leaving gold in the street" to describe something that is unexpectedly taken advantage of, which aligns with the first sense of "walk" as moving forward by taking steps.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses of "scoop," I would choose sense number 2: "get the better of."

The definition you provided for this sense ("the goal was to best the competition") matches well with the context of the sentence, which compares programs like Section 8 A to leaving gold in the street and being surprised when thieves come to steal it. It implies that the speaker sees these programs as succeeding or excelling over others, rather than simply taking something out or up.

Here's my response in the requested format:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word "one," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - a single person or thing

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this interpretation because it refers to multiple scandals involving different organizations, but the word "one" is used in relation to a singular entity (i.e., "among them"). Additionally, the example sentence provided supports this interpretation by referring to a single cellar window that is not easily noticeable without a police investigation. Therefore, the second sense of "one" seems to be the best fit for the given context.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the best fit for the ambiguous word "have" is sense number 1:

Sense Number: 1 Definition: have or possess, either in a concrete or an abstract sense Example: When negotiating with your union, do you make sure employees have a choice between new benefits and their cent per hour cost in wages?
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the word "characteristic" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The context mentions "scandals" that share similarities with Wedtech, indicating that the speaker is highlighting common traits or attributes between these entities. Therefore, the first definition of "characteristic," which refers to a prominent attribute or aspect of something, aligns best with the given text.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word "take_place," I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate sense. Here's why:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense of "take_place" fits perfectly with the context provided: "It takes place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption." The phrase "it takes place" implies a happening or occurrence, which aligns with the meaning of "come to pass" in sense number 1. Additionally, the mention of government programs being "tailor-made for corruption" suggests that something illegal or unethical is taking place, which supports the idea of "take_place" referring to an event or action that occurs over time.

Frequency count: 60

Example sentence: "For any good purpose, it takes place in the household, a rite of well-wishing for many occasions."

Overall, sense number 1 seems like the best fit for the given context and information provided.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "program" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2

The definition given for this sense matches the context perfectly: "a system of projects or services intended to meet a public need." The phrase "seem tailor-made for corruption" suggests that the context is discussing government programs that are designed to address specific issues or problems, which aligns with the meaning of "system of projects or services." Additionally, the example provided ("How long has it been since you reviewed the objectives of your benefit and service program?") further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'seem' is:

Sense Number: 2 - seem to be true, probable, or apparent

The context provides evidence for this sense as it mentions "government programs" which implies a formal or official setting where things should be truthful and not misleading. Additionally, the phrase "tailor-made for corruption" suggests that something is being presented as ideal or suitable for a particular purpose when in reality it may not be true or accurate. This fits well with the definition of the second sense of 'seem', which refers to something appearing to be true or likely.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "program," I would choose sense number 2:

"Sense Number: 2"

In this context, "program" likely refers to a system of projects or services intended to meet a public need. The mention of reviewing objectives and meeting a public need supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I believe the best sense of "eliminate" in this case is:

Sense Number: 6

The sentence "Why are programs like this not eliminated?" implies that the speaker wants to know why something is still present or active, rather than why something else is absent or terminated. In this context, "eliminated" means "removed" or "taken out," which fits well with the sixth sense definition provided.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of "provide" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2

The given sentence "Feeding Frenzy does provide a few clues." suggests that the speaker is referring to providing something desirable or needed, especially support, food, or sustenance. Therefore, sense number 2 best fits the context and meaning of the word "provide" in this instance.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the word "clue" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Evidence that helps to solve a problem.

The phrase "Feeding Frenzy" in the context you provided seems to imply a situation where something is being solved or investigated, which aligns with the definition of "clue" as evidence that helps to solve a problem. The example sentence also supports this interpretation, as it mentions Sherlock Holmes providing a clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would choose Sense Number 1 as the most appropriate definition of 'group'.

The usage of 'group' in the context you provided aligns well with the first sense definition, where it refers to any number of entities (members) considered as a unit. The mention of restrictions on employee benefits and the reference to a recent union contract suggest that the term 'group' is being used to describe a collection of individuals working together within an organization.

Here's why I ruled out the other two senses:

* Sense Number 2 does not fit quite nicely with the context provided. While it is true that some chemical compounds can be referred to as 'groups', the term is not typically used to describe collections of employees or members of an organization.
* Sense Number 3 is not relevant in this case because there is no indication in the text that the group being discussed is a mathematical set.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 1"
Response: Sure! I'm happy to help with WSD. Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "people" is:

Sense Number: 1 - (plural) any group of human beings (men or women or children) collectively.

This definition matches the context where the term is used to refer to different groups of individuals within various levels of government in the United States. The example sentence also supports this interpretation, as it refers to "her people" in the context of a historical figure commemorating their past achievements and inspiring their descendants to continue them.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses of the ambiguous word 'describe', I would choose Sense Number 1 as the most appropriate meaning for the word in this case.

The definition provided under Sense Number 1 matches well with the context provided: "to give a description of". The phrase "His next major work, completed in 1892, was a long fantastic epic in prose, entitled Hans Alienus, which Professor Bo ^ o ^ k describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth." supports this choice, as it shows how the speaker is using the verb 'describe' to provide a detailed explanation of something. Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 1"
Response: Sure! I will help you determine which sense of "belong" fits best in the given context. After analyzing the information provided, my answer is:

Sense Number: 5

The usage of "belong" in the given context matches best with sense 5, meaning "be a member, adherent, inhabitant, etc. (of a group, organization, or place)". In this sense, the phrase "groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party" implies that these individuals are members or affiliates of specific groups within the government sector. Therefore, option 5 is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the word "know" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense is "be cognizant or aware of a fact or a specific piece of information; possess knowledge or information about". In the given context, the phrase "they know that whenever government is redistributing wealth..." implies that someone has knowledge or awareness about the fact that when government engages in certain activities such as redistributing wealth, regulating commerce, or maintaining a large defense establishment, there is often opportunities for making money through influence, brokerage, or sales. Therefore, sense number 1 best fits the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'government', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided for sense number 1 matches well with the context of the passage.

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided best matches the meaning of the word in the given context. In this context, "wealth" refers to the state of being rich and affluent, which aligns with the first sense provided. The phrase "there is big money to be made in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government" implies that the speaker is referring to financial gain, which supports the idea that "wealth" means being rich and affluent. Additionally, the examples provided in the other senses do not fit as well with the context, particularly the second sense, which seems to refer to something else entirely.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word 'regulate', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2

The context of the passage suggests that the author is referring to the act of bringing something into conformity with rules or principles, specifically when it comes to laws related to government policies such as redistributing wealth, commerce, or military spending. The phrase "regulate" in this context implies imposing controls or restrictions on these activities, rather than simply fixing or adjusting them. Therefore, sense number 2 best fits the meaning of the word in this particular sentence.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "commerce" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Transactions (sales and purchases) having the objective of supplying commodities (goods and services)

The context mentions "redistributing wealth," "regulating commerce," and "maintaining a large defense establishment," which aligns with the definition of Commerce as transactions involving the buying and selling of goods and services. Additionally, the example provided in the context also supports this sense, as it refers to the Secretary of the Interior requiring reports from operators of mines that supply commodities that enter or affect commerce.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context of the passage provides evidence that the speaker is using the sense of "maintain" related to keeping something safe and protected. The phrase "big money to be made in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government" suggests that the speaker is referring to the maintenance of financial interests through political means. The examples provided in the possible senses do not fit the context of the passage as well as sense number 2 does. For instance, sense number 1 refers to keeping something in a certain state, position, or activity, which does not align with the idea of making money through political influence. Similarly, sense number 3 refers to supplying necessities and support, which is also unrelated to the context of the passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "establishment," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2

The context of the passage mentions "government" several times, and the term "establishment" is used in relation to "maintaining" and "regulating" government actions. This aligns with the definition of sense number 2, which refers to an organization founded and united for a specific purpose. The example provided also supports this interpretation, as it mentions breaking up an "unfortunate establishment."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'money' in this case is:

"Sense Number: 1"

The context of the passage highlights the idea of earning money through illegal means, such as influencing, brokering, or selling government processes and decisions. In this scenario, the sense of 'money' referring to the most common medium of exchange and legal tender is the most relevant. The author mentions specific examples of how money can be earned illegally, such as through profit-sharing and changing money into other currencies, which further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Based on the context and the given list of possible senses, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word "make" in the sentence you provided is:

Sense Number: 4
Definition: cause to do; cause to act in a specified manner

In this sense, the word "make" implies causing someone or something to take action or to be in a particular state. Given the context of the sentence, where the author mentions government agencies redistributing wealth, regulating commerce, or maintaining a large defense establishment, it seems likely that the author intended to convey this meaning of "make."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate definition of "influence" in the given passage:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: Have and exert influence or effect

The passage mentions "government...redistributing wealth," "regulating commerce," and "maintaining a large defense establishment." These are all examples of actions that governments can take, and they suggest that the speaker believes that there is money to be made in shaping or influencing these policies. Therefore, sense number 1, which refers to having and exerting influence or effect, seems like the most fitting choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "broker" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2

Description: Act as a mediator or intermediary between two or more parties in order to facilitate a transaction or agreement.

Frequency: 5

Example: They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth, regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment, there is big money to be made in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government.

This sense of "broker" makes sense in the context of the passage because it implies that the individuals involved in influencing, brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government are acting as intermediaries between different groups with competing interests.
Warning: No sense key found for instance d001.s036.t011.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word 'decision', I would choose sense number 2 as the most appropriate meaning:

"Sense Number: 2"

In this context, the word 'decision' refers to a position or opinion or judgment reached after consideration. This sense makes the most sense in light of the statement's focus on government policies and actions, such as redistributing wealth, regulating commerce, and maintaining a large defense establishment. It seems likely that the speaker is referring to a deliberate choice or course of action taken by these entities rather than a simple act of choosing or a sporting event outcome.
Response: 
Sense Number: 1

The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is referring to the sense of "have" as meaning "possess or hold". The phrase "they have absolutely no wish to see anything change" implies that the subject group possesses some quality or attribute that they are unwilling to relinquish. Therefore, the most appropriate sense of "have" in this context is sense number 1.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'wish', I would choose sense number 3 as the most appropriate.

The definition of sense number 3 fits well with the context of the sentence: "a polite expression of desire for someone's welfare". In this sentence, the speaker is expressing their good wishes towards something or someone, rather than indicating a specific desire or inclination.

Frequency count for sense number 3 is also relatively high compared to the other senses, which further supports its selection as the most appropriate sense in this case.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 3"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the word "see" in this case is:

Sense Number: 14

The given sentence "They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change" implies that the speaker is referring to the second definition of the word "change," which means "undergo a change; become different in essence." In this context, the speaker is suggesting that the group being referred to is resistant to any changes, indicating that they want to maintain their current state or essence.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "exist" is:

Sense Number: 2 – Support oneself

The definition of this sense matches well with the context you provided: "how many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders?" It implies that the speaker is asking how many government programs and policies are being maintained or supported financially by political insiders.

Example sentence: "If the company doesn't make profits, it may not be able to exist for long."

Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence "How many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders?" suggests that the speaker is questioning the number of government programs and policies that benefit politically influential individuals. Therefore, the best fit among the given options is sense #2, which refers to a mark that is long relative to its width. This definition matches the idea of politicians benefiting financially from their positions of authority.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "pocket", I would choose sense number 2 as the most appropriate meaning:

"Sense Number: 2 - An enclosed space."

In this context, the phrase "line the pockets of political insiders" implies a hidden or secret storage area, which aligns better with the definition of an enclosed space rather than the other possible meanings such as a small pouch, a supply of money, a bowling term, etc.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "issue" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense of "issue" fits best with the context provided: "an important question that is in dispute and must be settled." The phrase "the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal" implies that there is a significant problem or controversy involved, which aligns with the first sense of "issue" as something that is important and needs to be addressed.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and examples, I believe the most appropriate sense of "raise" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - raise from a lower to a higher position

The phrase "this is the real issue raised by the Wedtech scandal" implies that the speaker is referring to a particular problem or challenge that has been brought to light, rather than simply mentioning the scandal itself. Given the context, it makes more sense that the speaker is using "raise" to mean "bring up" or "call attention to," rather than any other sense of the word.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 1 for the verb "reach":

"Sense Number: 1"

The definition you provided for sense number 1 matches well with the context of the sentence, where someone is asking if they want to ride in a hot air balloon (montgolfière) during a social gathering (dinner). The phrase "reached port" implies that something has been accomplished or completed, which fits well with the idea of planning a trip or adventure. Additionally, the frequency of this sense in a large corpus of texts supports its selection as the most likely meaning in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of "lean" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The sentence "He walked up to the lieutenant's office, leaned wearily against the gun rack..." suggests that the speaker is using the verb "lean" to mean "to incline or bend from a vertical position." This sense of the word fits well with the physical action described in the sentence, where the speaker leans against a rack of guns.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word "ask" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Make a request or demand for something to somebody.

In the context of the sentence, the speaker is being asked if they want to ride in a hot air balloon, which aligns well with the second definition of "ask". Additionally, the sentence explicitly mentions the person making the request ("monsieur avec clipboard") and their expectation that the speaker will provide an answer, further supporting this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I believe the most appropriate sense of "want" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Have need of

In this context, "want" can be interpreted as meaning "have need of," as the speaker is referring to something that they require or need, specifically the ability to give someone credit for their work. This sense is supported by the phrase "let your workers know what they're entitled to," which implies that the speaker needs information about what their employees are eligible for.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of "ride" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Be carried or travel on or in a vehicle.

The sentence "I had to reach back to French 101 when the monsieur avec clipboard leaned over my shoulder during the coffee phase of dinner and asked whether I wanted to ride in a montgolfière" implies that the speaker is referring to getting into some kind of transportation vehicle, such as a hot air balloon. Therefore, sense 2, which refers to being carried or traveling on or in a vehicle, is the best fit for the context.
Response: 
Sense Number: 1

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for the first definition of "read" as "interpret something that is written or printed." The mention of "eating," "drinking," "smoking," and "sleeping" suggests a casual gathering or event where people are relaxing and enjoying themselves, rather than attending a formal conference or meeting. Additionally, the use of the present participle "reading" instead of the past tense "read" further supports this interpretation.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence that the speaker is using the second sense of "take up" – meaning "adopt." The mention of "French journalism convention" and "early Church Fathers" suggest a historical or academic setting, which aligns with the definition of "adopt." Additionally, the phrase "flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear" implies military strategy, further supporting the idea that the speaker means "adopt."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "man," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - someone who serves in the armed forces; a member of a military force

In this context, the use of the word "man" seems most likely to refer to a soldier or member of the military, rather than a civilian or non-military person. The phrase "halfhearted attempt to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary" suggests that the speaker may be trying to incorporate something new or unfamiliar into their plans, but are not fully committed to doing so. Given the mention of a "clipboard," which could imply organization or planning, it makes sense that the speaker might be referring to a military personnel or someone involved in organizing a group activity.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "represent" in the sentence is:

Sense Number: 2 - Express indirectly by an image, form, or model; be a symbol.

In this sense, "represent" means that the man with the clipboard is using an image or a model to convey a message or idea, rather than directly stating it. It could also imply that he is acting as a symbol or a proxy for something else, such as introducing a new concept or idea into the conversation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the best fit for the sense of "attempt" in the sentence is:

Sense Number: 2

In this context, the word "attempt" seems to connote the idea of making an effort or trying to do something, but with a negative connotation, as the author mentions "unsuccessful" and "setbacks." Therefore, the second definition of "attempt," which refers to the act of attacking or launching a hostile action, fits better than the first definition, which implies a more neutral or positive meaning.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is using the sense of "introduce" that means "bring something new to an environment." The mention of "back pressure" and the comparison to "normal pressure" suggest that the speaker is referring to the scientific or technical sense of the word. Additionally, the phrase "insure maximum mixing" further supports this interpretation, as it implies the introduction of something new (in this case, raw sewage) into an existing environment (the aeration tank).
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the meaning of "bit" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: a small piece or quantity of something

This definition matches well with the context provided, as the speaker seems to be referring to a small portion or amount of something related to travel or activity. The examples provided also support this interpretation, as they involve quantifying or measuring something.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "embody" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2

The sentence "my fellow conventioners were having none of it" implies that the speaker and others are rejecting or dismissing something, which aligns with the definition of "represent or express something abstract in tangible form" (Sense 3) does not fit well with the context. The phrase "made exclusive...in parliamentary hands" also supports this choice, as it suggests a formal, official representation rather than a personal or subjective one. Finally, while the other senses may be applicable in different contexts, the combination of language and meaning in the given passage strongly favors Sense 2 as the best fit.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "state," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 – the way something is with respect to its main attributes

In this context, the speaker is using the term "state" to refer to the current situation or condition of something, specifically the country being discussed. For example, the phrase "all Laos suffered a state of siege" implies that the entire country was experiencing some kind of difficult or challenging situation at that time. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the meaning of the word "state" in this particular passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "come_to" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - be relevant to

The context provides evidence for this sense because the speaker is contrasting their own understanding of a topic (war) with someone else's lack of understanding (Jeff), indicating that they are discussing something that is relevant or important to them. Additionally, the use of "but" to indicate a contrast further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure, here's my answer:

"Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence suggests that 'try' means 'put to the test, as for its quality, or give experimental use to.' This sense is supported by the mention of 'standard vacation time off' and 'depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year,' which implies testing or evaluating the effectiveness of something. Additionally, the use of 'try' in this context implies experimentation or evaluation rather than making an effort or attempting something."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would choose sense number 2: "discover or determine the existence, presence, or fact of".

The sentence "But as the French embody a Zen-like state of blasé when it comes to athletics try finding a Nautilus machine in Paris," suggests that the speaker is trying to locate something specific, which fits best with the definition of sense number 2. The use of the phrase "try finding" implies a deliberate act of seeking or locating something, rather than stumbling upon it accidentally.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "machine" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - an efficient person

The sentence "my fellow conventioners were having none of it" implies that the speaker and others around them are unable to understand or appreciate something, which aligns well with the definition of "efficient person". Additionally, the context does not suggest any of the other meanings of "machine", such as a device for transmitting or modifying energy, an organizational structure, a means of overcoming resistance, or a political party apparatus.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the verb "have" is:

Sense Number: 2

The context suggests that the speaker is referring to the idea of "having" or "possessing" something in a metaphorical or figurative sense, rather than in a literal or concrete sense. The phrase "try finding a Nautilus machine in Paris" implies that the speaker is looking for something rare or difficult to find, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. Additionally, the use of the word "blase" to describe the French people's attitude towards athletics further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the best sense of "diner" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 – Definition: a person eating a meal (especially in a restaurant)

This is because the passage mentions people sitting at a table and enjoying a meal, which aligns with the definition of "diner" as a person who eats a meal, particularly in a restaurant setting. There are no examples provided for senses 2 or 3, so they do not apply in this case.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses provided, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "light" in this sentence is:

Sense Number: 4 - Cause to start burning; subject to fire or great heat

In this sentence, "light" can be interpreted as meaning "cause to start burning," as the speaker mentions "Gauloises" being lit, suggesting that something is being ignited or set ablaze. Therefore, sense number 4 is the most suitable choice for this context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context provided, the best interpretation of the word "scoff" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Laugh at with contempt and derision

This sense makes the most sense given the context of the sentence, where the speaker is rejecting the idea of interrupting their Saturday morning activities to go golfing or even hot air ballooning. The use of the phrase "she scoffed" implies a mocking or dismissive tone, which aligns better with the definition of laughing at something with contempt and derision rather than treating it with contemptuous disregard as per sense number 2.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I believe the most appropriate sense of "interrupt" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – destroy the peace or tranquility of

In the given sentence, the speaker is referring to the fact that something (the coyote's call) is disturbing their peaceful moment, and they hope it won't happen again. This sense of "interrupt" fits well with the context and makes the most sense considering the situation described.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "morning," I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate meaning:

"Sense Number: 1"

In this context, it seems likely that the speaker is referring to the time period between dawn and noon, rather than any other definition of the word. The mention of going golfing or even montgolfing ballooning (a recreational activity) further supports this interpretation, as these activities are typically done during the daytime hours. Additionally, the reference to the Montgolfier brothers being the world's first hot-air balloonists also suggests that the speaker is thinking about the morning time period.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the verb "win" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Win something through one's efforts

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense, as it mentions "catch[ing] the next fishing boat back to England," which implies that someone's efforts have led to achieving a specific goal or outcome. Therefore, the sense of "win" that best fits in this context is the second definition, where the subject "wins" something through their own efforts.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the best definition for "response" in this case is:

    Sense Number: 3

The sentence "Back in the U.S.A. this kind of chi-chi airborne activity wins heartwarmingly covetous responses" suggests that the speaker is referring to statements or replies given in response to something else, likely a question or request. Therefore, sense number 3, which defines "response" as a statement made in reply to a question or request, is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would choose Sense Number 1 as the best fit for the ambiguous word "balloon" in the sentence "You went ballooning?"

Here's why:

* Definition: Ride in a hot-air balloon
	+ Frequency: High (This sense of the word occurs frequently in a large corpus of texts, indicating that it is a common and widely recognized usage of the term.)
	+ Example sentence: He tried to balloon around the earth but storms forced him to land in China
* Other senses do not fit the context as well:
	+ Sense Number 2 does not match the context of the sentence, which implies that someone is asking about going up in a hot-air balloon. This sense refers to becoming inflated, which does not make sense in this context.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 1"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "seem," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - seem to be true, probable, or apparent

In this context, the word "seems" implies that something appears to be true or likely, rather than giving a specific impression or having a particular outward aspect. The phrase "it seems that..." suggests a possibility or probability, which aligns best with sense 2.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context provided, the best definition of "follow" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: to travel behind, go after, come after

The phrase "It seems Americans have followed Malcom Forbes's hot air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way" implies that there is a group of people who are following the actions or footsteps of Malcolm Forbes, possibly in a recreational or enthusiastic manner. Therefore, the sense of "follow" that refers to moving behind or coming after someone or something is the most relevant in this context.
Response: 
Sense Number: 4
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense, my answer would be:

"Sense Number: 2: Develop a habit; apply oneself to a practice or occupation."

The reason why I choose this sense is because the phrase "took to" in the context suggests that Americans have developed a habit or applied themselves to the activity of ballooning in a serious manner. The reference to Malcolm Forbes' hot air balloons also supports this interpretation, as he was known for his enthusiasm and advocacy of hot air ballooning. In contrast, the other sense ("have a fancy or particular liking or desire for") does not seem to fit the context as well, as there is no indication that the speaker has a personal preference for hot air ballooning.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word "number" is:

Sense Number: 2 – Definition: a concept of quantity involving zero and units.

The context mentions the number of balloonists who have taken a Federal Aviation Authority lighter-than-air test, which suggests that the speaker is using the term "number" to refer to a quantitative measure or amount of something. Additionally, the example sentence provided highlights the idea of quantities being used to express amounts, further supporting this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the verb "pass" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2
Definition: move past
Example: Early in June , the Discovery passed “Desolation” ( southern Greenland ) and in mid-June entered the “Furious Overfall”.

This sense of "pass" fits best in the context of the sentence provided, as it refers to the ship moving past a location.
Response: Sure! I can help you determine which sense of the word "test" best fits in the given context. After analyzing the information provided, I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - Any standardized procedure for measuring...

In this context, the author is referring to the act of administering a test to measure the reading achievement and intelligence of a group of people, particularly third graders in different schools. This sense of the word "test" aligns with the examples provided, which describe the administration of standardized tests to evaluate cognitive abilities such as reading comprehension and intelligence quotient (IQ).
Response: Sure! I can help you figure out which sense of 'swell' best fits the given context. After analyzing the information provided, I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: increase in size, magnitude, number, or intensity

The context provides evidence for this sense through the mention of the number of balloonists increasing over time, with some estimates reaching as high as 10,000. The phrase "the music swelled to a crescendo" also supports this sense, as it implies an increase in volume or intensity. Therefore, the first sense of 'swell' is the most suitable option for the given passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of "estimate" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – a judgment of the qualities of something or somebody

In this passage, the author is using "estimate" to refer to their own assessment or evaluation of the number of balloonists who have passed a Federal Aviation Authority test over the past 25 years. The author is making a judgment call on the basis of available data and information, rather than providing an exact calculation or measurement. Therefore, sense 2 best captures the meaning of "estimate" in this instance.
Response: 
Sense Number: 1
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and examples, I believe the most appropriate sense of the word 'hold' in this passage is:

"Sense Number: 2 (keep in a certain state, position, or activity)"

This definition matches the context of the passage, where the author is describing the various ways in which the word 'hold' can be used, such as keeping something in a certain state or position, or keeping something in one's hands. The examples provided in the passage also align with this definition, such as holding a command, keeping a thought in mind, or organizing or being responsible for something.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "include" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Consider as part of something.

In the given context, the author is using "include" to refer to the idea of considering something as part of a larger group or category. For instance, when mentioning the various shapes of balloons at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, the author notes that some of them are "fetchingly shaped to resemble Carmen Miranda, Garfield, or a 12-story-high condom." Here, the author is considering these objects as part of the broader category of things that can be shaped like famous figures or oversized objects. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the meaning of "include" in this passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the verb "attract" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Be attractive to

The context describes various events and activities related to balloon festivals, including the shape of some balloons being compared to famous people or objects. The phrase "fetchingly shaped to resemble" implies that these balloons are visually appealing or attractive. Therefore, sense 2, which refers to something being attractive to someone or something else, seems like the best fit for the given context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'balloon' is:

Sense Number: 2 – Small thin inflatable rubber bag with narrow neck.

The context provides evidence for this sense through the mention of small, thin bags and narrow necks, which aligns better with the definition of sense 2. Additionally, the examples provided illustrate how the term might be used when referring to a specific type of balloon, such as those used in scientific experiments or demonstrations.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best definition for the word "shape" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2

The sentence "Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players, coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football." clearly implies that the word "shape" means "make something, usually for a specific function". In this case, the author is describing how someone made a pair of silver cufflinks with a specific design, likely for a particular occasion or event. Therefore, sense number 2 is the most suitable choice for the context provided.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about the possible senses of the ambiguous word "resemble", I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1

The context of the passage provides several clues that suggest this sense of "resemble" is the most likely choice. For instance, the phrase "some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble Carmen Miranda" implies that the things being described are meant to look like a specific person or thing. Additionally, the reference to "Garfield" later in the passage suggests that the author is using "resemble" to describe something that has a superficial similarity to another entity, rather than a deeper connection. Overall, the language and imagery of the passage suggest that the author is using "resemble" to convey a comparison between different objects or people based on their outward appearance, which aligns with the definition provided for Sense Number 1.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the provided senses of the word "balloon", I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for sense number 1 matches the context of the sentence better than the other two options. In the sentence "The condom balloon was denied official entry status this year.", the word "balloon" likely refers to a large, non-rigid bag filled with gas or heated air. This sense makes more sense in the context of the sentence because a small, thin inflatable rubber bag (as described in sense number 2) does not seem relevant to the situation. Additionally, the frequency of this sense in a large corpus of texts supports its selection, as it occurs 7 times more frequently than the second most common sense.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

In the given context, the best fit for the ambiguous word "deny" is sense number 2, which means "refuse to accept or believe". This makes perfect sense considering the sentence "The condom balloon was denied official entry status this year." implies that something was refused or rejected, which aligns well with the definition of refusing to accept or believe something. Additionally, the other senses do not seem to apply as directly to the context, such as sense number 1, which refers to declaring something untrue, or sense number 3, which refers to refusing to grant something.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word "status," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2

In this context, the word "status" can be understood as a state at a particular time, which fits with the meaning of the second sense provided. The sentence "The condom balloon was denied official entry status this year" implies that the balloon did not meet certain requirements or standards at a specific point in time, rather than referring to its social or professional standing within a society.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2
The word "hold" in this context most likely means "have or keep in one's hands or grip."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'attraction', I would choose sense number 2 as the most appropriate.

"Sense Number: 2"

In this context, 'attraction' can be interpreted as an entertainment that is offered to the public. The phrase "sunrise root-canal work" implies that the activity being referred to is not particularly enjoyable or exciting, but rather something that needs to be done regardless of how it may affect others. Therefore, the second definition of 'attraction' as an entertainment or spectacle seems like the best fit.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "feel" in the sentence is:

Sense Number: 1

The phrase "I felt the nagging of a culture imperative" suggests that the speaker was experiencing some kind of emotional or psychological sensation, rather than physically examining something or actively searching for something. Therefore, the first definition of "feel," which refers to undergoing an emotional sensation or being in a particular state of mind, seems like the most likely choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "sign_up" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Join a club, an activity, etc. with the intention to join or participate.

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for this sense, as it implies that the speaker has taken action to formally join something, such as a club or event, after feeling an influence or pressure from cultural norms or expectations. The mention of signing up "promptly" also supports this interpretation, as it suggests a quick and decisive action.

Additionally, the frequency statistics provided suggest that this sense of "sign_up" is more common than the other option, which further supports its selection as the best fit for the context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word "thing" is:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: a special situation
Example: He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence with things as they were .

This sense of "thing" fits best in the context because the author is referring to a particular state of affairs or condition, rather than an object or action. The use of the phrase "as they were" further supports this interpretation, as it implies a change or shift from a previous state.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word 'tell' is sense number 2: Let something be known.

The context provides information about someone sharing information with another person, which aligns well with the definition of sense number 2. For instance, the phrase "He said that he had already told the police chief" implies that the speaker has previously shared information with the police chief. Additionally, the context does not suggest any other senses of the word 'tell', such as giving instructions or narrating a story, which further supports the choice of sense number 2.

Therefore, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I believe the most appropriate sense of the verb "require" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Consider obligatory; request and expect

In the given context, the phrase "which is more economical for your plant" implies that there are different options available and someone is considering which one is best suited for their needs. Additionally, the mention of "plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups" suggests that there is some kind of organizational or communal aspect to the decision-making process. These factors suggest that the second sense of "require," which refers to considering something obligatory or making requests and expecting compliance, is the most relevant here.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "zip", I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 3 - Forceful exertion

In the given context, the author mentions that "it looks like nothing they have ever seen before" which implies some kind of sudden or unexpected movement or action. The phrase "derring-do" also suggests boldness or courage, which aligns well with the definition of sense 3. Therefore, I believe the author intended to convey the meaning of "forceful exertion" when using the word "zip".
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 1 as the best fit for the ambiguous word "look" in the sentence "So long as you don't look down."

Sense Number: 1
Response: 
"Sense Number: 2"

The context of the sentence "They will also tell you that even if you hate heights , you can still balloon." best fits sense number 2 of the possible senses for the ambiguous word "tell". In this sense, "tell" means "let something be known", which aligns with the meaning of the sentence where the speaker is saying they will reveal information about being able to go hot air ballooning despite having a fear of heights.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word "hate," I would choose Sense Number 1 as the most appropriate sense:

"Sense Number: 1"

In this context, the sentence "They will also tell you that even if you hate heights, you can still balloon." implies that the speaker is using the word "hate" to mean "dislike intensely." The fact that the word "balloon" follows the phrase "even if you hate heights" further supports this interpretation, as it suggests that the speaker is using "hate" in its negative sense. Therefore, the most likely sense of the word "hate" in this context is Sense Number 1, which defines the word as meaning "to dislike intensely; feel antipathy or aversion towards."
Response: Sure! I am happy to help with your query as a linguistic expert in WSD. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'balloon', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - Become inflated

The sentence "They will also tell you that even if you hate heights, you can still balloon" implies that something ( likely the sails) has become inflated or puffed up, which aligns better with the definition of sense #2 than the other options. The fact that there are no specific references to hot air balloons or traveling in them further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would determine that the best sense of "say" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: express in words

The context of the sentence "I still say don't look down." implies that the speaker is using "say" to mean expressing their own opinion or viewpoint. This sense of "say" is the most relevant here because it aligns with the idea of the speaker offering their own thoughts or advice without necessarily reporting or maintaining information that has already been established.
Response: Sure, here's my answer:

"Sense Number: 1"

The given context "I still say don't look down." best fits the first definition of "look," which means "perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards." This sense is also supported by the fact that there is no indication in the context that the speaker is referring to a particular impression or outward aspect of something, but rather is giving advice not to focus on something low. Therefore, option 1 is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the context given, the best fit for the sense of 'ascend' would be:

Sense Number: 2 - Go back in order of genealogical succession.

The context of 'At least not when you are ascending.' suggests that the speaker is referring to something going back in order of genealogical succession, rather than moving upward or appearing to do so. Additionally, the other examples provided under this sense suggest that it is the most likely interpretation of the word in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "tell" is:

Sense Number: 2 – Let something be known

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for this interpretation because it implies that someone is sharing information or making something known to another person.

The phrase "what they won't tell you is not to go aloft in anything you don't want to get wet" suggests that there is something dangerous or undesirable about going upwards, perhaps implying a risk of getting wet. Therefore, the most fitting definition of "go" in this context is sense number 1, which refers to changing location or proceeding metaphorically.

Sense Number: 2 - Be relevant to

In the given passage, the author uses the term "refer" to indicate that something is related or connected to something else. For instance, when the author says "He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools," it means that the speaker is highlighting the specific aspect of the college situation that relates to the preparatory schools. Therefore, sense number 2 - Be relevant to - is the most appropriate choice for the given context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best sense of "begin" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: take the first step or steps in carrying out an action

The sentence "my maiden voyage and novitiates are referred to as virgins began at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field" suggests that the speaker is using "begin" to indicate the starting point of a journey or activity. The phrase "maiden voyage" and "novitiates" further reinforce this interpretation, as they both refer to the initiation of something new or unfamiliar. Therefore, sense number 1, which defines "begin" as taking the first step or steps in carrying out an action, seems like the most suitable choice for this context.

The sentence "Does our society have a runaway, uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization, or a normal, healthy growth?" suggests that the speaker is concerned about the potential negative consequences of technological advancements and whether they will lead to the downfall of society. Therefore, sense number 2 best fits the meaning of the word 'end' in this context.
Response: 
Sense Number: 9

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for the ninth sense of "flight" which is defined as "a scheduled trip by plane between designated airports".

Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word 'stand' in this sentence is:

Sense Number: 2 – be in some specified state or condition

Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'decided', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 4

The sentence "In between came lots of coffee drinking while watching the balloons inflate and lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order" implies that the act of deciding is being performed repeatedly throughout the situation described. This aligns with the definition of 'decide' as bringing something to an end or settling it conclusively. Therefore, option 4 best fits the context provided.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the verb "fly" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – move quickly or suddenly

The context describes a situation where people are gathered together, waiting for something to happen (inflating balloons), and there are multiple mentions of movement happening quickly (drinking coffee, standing around deciding who will fly in which balloon, etc.). Additionally, the example sentence provided highlights the quick movements of someone making adjustments. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the meaning of the verb "fly" in this particular passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "basket" is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided for sense number 1 ("a container that is usually woven and has handles") fits well with the context of the passage. The mention of handling the baskets and the fact that they are not necessarily made of metal or plastic supports this interpretation. Additionally, the examples provided in the passage also align with this sense, such as "Get a basket," where it seems likely that the speaker is asking someone to retrieve a woven basket from somewhere.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "hold" in this case is:

Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "progress," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - the act of moving forward (as toward a goal)

The context of the sentence provides evidence that the speaker is referring to the act of moving forward towards a specific goal, rather than a general gradual improvement or growth. The phrase "step-by-step progress" also supports this interpretation. Therefore, I conclude that the best sense of the word "progress" in this context is sense number 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'listen', I would choose sense number 2: 'listen and pay attention'.

The context provides evidence that the speaker is actively paying attention to what the driver is saying over the walkie-talkie, rather than just hearing it passively. For instance, the speaker responds with "Uhhu" and "I see" at intervals, which suggests they are actively engaging with the information being conveyed. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the intended meaning of the verb 'listen' in this context.

So, the answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word "driver" is:

Sense Number: 1

Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the intended meaning of the author.

Sense Number: 2
Definition: reach a destination; arrive by movement or progress

In the given sentence, the author describes their experience of floating above the Vosges mountains and observing the rising mist and cows grazing in the fields. There is no indication of movement towards a specific location or arrival at any particular place, which supports the definition of sense 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, I would say that the best sense of the ambiguous word 'minute' in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided fits well with the context of the sentence, as the author mentions drifting above the Vosges and watching the silver mists rise off the river, which suggests a specific period of time. Additionally, the usage of the word 'minutes' in the context implies a duration of time rather than a particular point in time or a measure of angle. Therefore, the most likely meaning of 'minute' in this sentence is a unit of time equal to 60 seconds or 1/60th of an hour.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "drift" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – wander from a direct course or at random

The sentence "After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the Vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields ." suggests that the speaker was floating or moving randomly in the air, which aligns best with the second definition of "drift".
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "watch" is:

Sense Number: 2 - Follow with the eyes or the mind

In the given passage, the author describes watching something in a detached manner, indicating that they are observing it from a distance rather than actively participating in it. This aligns best with the definition of "follow with the eyes or the mind," which implies a state of observation rather than direct involvement.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word 'rise', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 8

The sentence "After long stretches of this attendant ground activity came 20 or so lovely minutes of drifting above the Vosges watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields." supports this sense because it implies that the verb 'rise' means to go up or advance, specifically referring to the mist and the cows moving upwards.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'cow' is:

"Sense Number: 1 - Female of domestic cattle."

The context mentions "cattle" and "fields," which suggest a rural setting where domesticated animals are raised. The phrase "watching the silver mists rise off the river" also implies a peaceful, serene atmosphere, which is consistent with the idea of cows grazing in a pasture. Additionally, the absence of any mention of bulls or other males supports this interpretation. Therefore, the first definition of "cow" as a female of domestic cattle is the most likely meaning in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best sense of the ambiguous word 'amble' in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: walk leisurely

The context describes someone floating above the Vosges mountains, observing the mist rising from the river and cows grazing in the fields. This imagery evokes a slow and relaxed pace, which aligns well with the definition of "walk leisurely." Additionally, the phrase "ambling chords" further supports this interpretation as it implies a gentle, meandering motion.
Response: Sure! I can assist you in identifying the correct sense of the ambiguous word 'feel' in the given context. After analyzing the provided information, I suggest the second sense of 'feel' as the most appropriate choice:

"Sense Number: 2"

In this context, 'feel' means 'come to believe on the basis of emotion, intuitions, or indefinite grounds'. The phrase 'belle it all was' suggests a positive evaluation, and the mention of a pilot in a silly plaid beret implies a playful tone, both of which support the use of this sense of 'feel'. Additionally, the example sentence provided illustrates the idea of having a belief or conviction without necessarily relying on logical reasoning.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word "keep" in the sentence is sense number 2: "continue a certain state, condition, or activity."

Here's why: In the sentence, "Keep the pilot in silly plaid beret," the speaker seems to be referring to someone or something that is already in motion or existence, rather than starting something new. The phrase "in silly plaid beret" also implies that the person mentioned is associated with some sort of performance or act, which fits with the idea of continuing a certain state or activity. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the meaning of "keep" in this context.

So, "Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses provided, I would say that the best fit for the sense of 'point_out' in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - point out carefully and clearly

The phrase "my companion pointed out" in the context suggests that someone is highlighting or drawing attention to something specific, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. Additionally, the example provided ("In town after town...") implies that the person is providing detailed observations or explanations about what they are seeing, further supporting the choice of sense 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best definition of "come" in this passage is:

Sense Number: 2
Definition: reach a destination; arrive by movement or progress

In this passage, the narrator describes little French farmers and their wives emerging from their homes and looking at the speaker and the crew with confusion. This implies that they have arrived at the location where the speaker and the crew are present, suggesting that "come" in this context means "reach a destination."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the verb "put" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – cause to be in a certain state; cause to be in a certain relation

The sentence "little French farmers and their little French farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us" implies that the farmers and their wives were positioning themselves in a specific manner, likely to get a better view of something. This sense of "put" fits well with the context and does not seem to match any of the other available senses.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for the second sense of "hand" which refers to a hired laborer on a farm or ranch. The mention of a monthly wage and the comparison to other workers who earned $30 suggest that the speaker is referring to a worker on a farm rather than a prehensile extremity of the superior limb or a unit of length equal to 4 inches. Additionally, the phrase "little French farmers and their little French farmwives" implies a rural setting where agricultural work would be commonplace.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "squint" in the sentence you provided is:

Sense Number: 2 - be cross-eyed; have a squint or strabismus

The reason for this choice is that the phrase "put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us" suggests that the speakers are looking at someone with crossed eyes or a squint, which fits better with the definition of sense #2 than the other two options. Additionally, there isn't any evidence in the context to suggest that the speaker is experiencing blindness or discomfort from direct sunlight (as per sense #3), or using the word metaphorically to describe narrowing their gaze (as per sense #1).
Response: 
Sense Number: 1

The context of the sentence "We were coming down straight into their canal" suggests that the speaker is using the sense of "move towards, travel towards something or somebody or approach something or somebody". This sense is the most relevant to the context as it implies that the speaker and others are moving towards a specific location, which in this case is a canal.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I believe the most appropriate sense of "see" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: perceive by sight or have the power to perceive by sight

In the context of the sentence, "He asked to see a copy of Mrs. Meeker's will," the speaker is asking to physically view the document, indicating that they need to see it with their own eyes. Therefore, sense number 1, which refers to perceiving something by sight or having the power to perceive by sight, is the most suitable choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the best definition of "steer" in this instance would be:

Sense Number: 2 - Direct (oneself) somewhere

The context of the sentence "You can't steer it." implies that the speaker is referring to something that cannot be directed or controlled, which aligns with the second definition of "steer" as meaning to direct oneself somewhere. The phrase "you can't steer it" suggests that the subject of the sentence is something that does not have a defined path or destination, and therefore cannot be steered in any particular direction.
Response: 
Sense Number: 1
The given text supports the definition of “go” as “change location; move, travel, or proceed, also metaphorically.” In the context of the sentence, the speaker is suggesting that they can heat the balloon’s air with a propane burner to make the top of their head feel hot and ride the air currents, implying that they intend to move or travel in some manner.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "heat" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Provide with heat

In the given sentence, the verb "heat" is used to indicate the act of providing warmth or thermal energy to something or someone. This sense of "heat" aligns well with the context, as it describes the action of warming up the room. The other senses do not seem to fit as well in the context, especially since there is no mention of making anything hotter or arousing emotions.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'air' is:

    Sense Number: 2 - the region above the ground

The context of the sentence provides clear evidence for this sense, as it refers to the balloon being heated and rising in the air. The other senses do not fit as well in the context, especially since there is no mention of breathing or any other aspect related to gas composition.
Response: Sure! I have carefully analyzed the given text and determined that the most appropriate sense of the ambigious word "burner" in this context is:

Sense Number: 2

The definition you provided for this sense ("the heating elements of a stove or range on which pots and pans are placed for cooking") matches the language usage in the given sentence. In particular, the phrase "heat the balloon's air with a propane burner" suggests that the speaker is referring to the heating elements of a stove or range, rather than an apparatus for burning fuel or refuse. Additionally, the mention of "air currents" further supports this interpretation, as it implies that the heat generated by the burners is being used to warm the air inside the balloon. Therefore, I conclude that the best sense of the word "burner" in this context is sense number 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the given text and the provided list of possible senses, I believe the best interpretation of the verb "make" in this context is:

Sense Number: 45 - Cause to be enjoyable or pleasurable.

The phrase "It makes my day" implies that the action of heating the balloon with a propane burner is causing the speaker to experience pleasure or enjoyment.
Response: Sure! I will help you determine the correct meaning of the term "Top" in the given context. Based on the information provided, I believe the best interpretation of the term "Top" in this instance is:

Sense Number: 2 – The highest or uppermost side of something.

In the given sentence, "the top of your head" refers to the highest point or surface of one's head, which aligns with definition #2. It is worth noting that definitions #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, and #10 do not fit the context quite as well, as they relate to different meanings of the term "top."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 2: "come to believe on the basis of emotion, intuitions, or indefinite grounds".

The sentence "You can go only up or down by heating the balloon's air with a propane burner, which does make the top of your head feel hot and ride the air currents" suggests that the speaker is using the verb "feel" in the sense of having an emotional or intuitive belief or conviction. The phrase "make the top of your head feel hot" implies a subjective, internal experience, rather than a physical sensation or perception. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the meaning of the verb "feel" in this context.

So, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: 
"Sense Number: 2"

The context of the sentence "You can go only up or down by heating the balloon 's air with a propane burner , which does make the top of your head feel hot and ride the air currents ." supports the second definition of "ride" as "be carried or travel on or in a vehicle". This sense is further reinforced by the mention of a balloon and air currents, which are both objects or phenomena that cannot be sat upon or controlled directly. Therefore, it is unlikely that the speaker intended the first five definitions of "ride", which relate to sitting or controlling animals, moving objects, criticizing someone, having certain properties, or climbing up something.
Response: Sure! I have analyzed the given context and the provided list of possible senses for the ambiguous word "current". Based on my analysis, the most appropriate sense of "current" in this context is:

Sense Number: 2 - a steady flow of a fluid (usually from natural causes)

The reason for selecting this sense is that the context describes the movement of air currents, which aligns better with the definition of "current" as a steady flow of a fluid. The other two senses do not seem to fit well into the context, especially since there is no mention of electricity or a conductor involved in the scenario described.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "make" is:

Sense Number: 15: "Make by shaping or bringing together constituents."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "car," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided matches well with the context of the sentence "which makes the chase car necessary." In this case, the speaker is likely referring to a motor vehicle with four wheels, usually propelled by an internal combustion engine, which is the most common meaning of the word "car." Therefore, option 1 is the best fit.
Response: 
Sense Number: 2
The given sentence suggests that the speaker rarely goes higher than 2,000 feet, implying that the sense of "go" here means "follow a procedure or take a course".
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'average', I would choose Sense Number 2: "achieve or reach on average".

The sentence "Most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles an hour" implies that the speaker is referring to the rate at which something is being done or achieved, rather than the amount of something lost or gained. Therefore, Sense Number 2 best fits the context of the sentence.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "hour" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Clock time

The sentence "All the doors were open at this hour except one," suggests that the speaker is referring to a specific point in time measured by a clock. This sense of "hour" is the most relevant in this context as it aligns with the mention of "clock time" earlier in the passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "balloon" in the sentence is:

Sense Number: 2

The definition of this sense of "balloon" matches the context of the sentence perfectly. In this case, the speaker is referring to a small, thin, inflatable rubber bag with a narrow neck, which is the meaning of the second sense of "balloon". The example provided in the sense also helps to support this interpretation, as it mentions the balloon being "pulled or pressed out of shape", which is consistent with the idea of a small, flexible bag.

Therefore, I conclude that the intended meaning of the word "balloon" in the given sentence is "a small thin inflatable rubber bag with a narrow neck."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "cruise," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 2 - Travel at a moderate speed."

The context of the sentence suggests a continuous and steady movement, which aligns better with the definition of sense 2 than the other options. Additionally, the mention of being "steady altitude" implies a consistent pace rather than the stop-and-go nature of sense 3, or the specific location of sense 4.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word "ascend" in the sentence you provided is:

Sense Number: 2 – Go back in order of genealogical succession

The context of the sentence provides evidence that the speaker is referring to the idea of something going "up" in a hierarchical or chronological sense, rather than physically moving upward. The phrase "trop rapidemente" ("too quickly") further supports this interpretation, as it implies that the movement is not physical but rather temporal. Additionally, the mention of the speaker being "in our case descending a tad trop rapidemente" confirms that they are referring to a change in position within a hierarchy, rather than a physical movement upward.
Response: Sure! I can assist you with identifying the correct sense of the word " descend" based on the given context and possible senses. After analyzing the information provided, I believe the most appropriate sense for the word "descend" in the given context is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of sense number 1 is "move downward and lower, but not necessarily all the way." This fits perfectly into the context of the sentence, where the author describes feeling "airborne in a picnic basket" while descending rapidly. It implies that the descent is not complete, but rather a partial movement downwards.

Therefore, the answer is sense number 1.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best sense of "do" is:

Sense Number: 2 - carry out or perform an action

The context suggests that the speaker is asking about what the other person is doing, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. Specifically, the speaker is curious about what the other person is engaged in or carrying out at the moment.
Response: Sure! I can help you determine the correct sense of the word "hiss" in the given context. After analyzing the information provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of "hiss" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Make a sharp hissing sound, as if to show disapproval

The reason for selecting this sense is that the context of the sentence implies that someone is expressing surprise or displeasure at something, which aligns well with the definition of making a hissing sound to show disapproval. The fact that the speaker's companion's knuckles are white also supports this interpretation, as it suggests they are feeling anxious or upset about something.

Here are some additional reasons why I ruled out the other senses:

* Sense number 2 does not fit well in the context because there is no mention of anything moving with a whooshing sound.
* Sense number 3 does not fit well in the context because there is no indication of any expression or utterance being made.
* Sense number 4 does not fit well in the context because there is no evidence of any performance or speech taking place that might elicit a hiss of disapproval.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word "companion," I would determine that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 – Definition: a traveler who accompanies you

In this context, the phrase "his companion" refers to someone who is accompanying the speaker, which fits best with the definition of a traveler who is accompanying another person. The fact that the speaker's companion is white and points out schools in different towns further supports this interpretation. While sense numbers 1 and 3 could also be applicable, they do not fit as well with the context provided.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'yell', I would choose sense number 2: "utter or declare in a very loud voice".

Here's why: In the given context, the pilot's shout of "Attention!" sounds like it should be interpreted as a loud declaration rather than a sudden loud cry. The phrase "plunged into the canal" also suggests a more dramatic and urgent situation, which aligns better with the meaning of "declare" than "cry". Additionally, the example sentence provided ("Mike yelled to the catcher") supports this interpretation further.

So, my answer is: "Sense Number: 2".
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context provided, the best definition of "pilot" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - someone who is licensed to operate an aircraft in flight

The example given in the passage supports this sense, as it describes a situation where the pilot of a plane is yelling instructions as the plane crashes into a canal. This usage aligns with the first definition of "pilot," which refers to someone who operates an aircraft in flight.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'basket', I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate definition:

"Sense Number: 1"

The context of the sentence "Attention , yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal" suggests that the speaker is referring to a container that is typically made of woven materials and has handles. This fits well with the first definition of 'basket' provided in the list, which defines it as a container that is usually woven and has handles. Therefore, I believe that the intended meaning of the word 'basket' in this context is sense number 1.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would choose Sense Number 2: Definition - drop steeply.

The sentence "Attention, yelled our pilot as our basket plunged into the canal" implies that the noun "plunge" refers to a sudden and steep descent into something, such as water. This fits best with Sense Number 2, which defines "plunge" as "drop steeply."

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would choose sense number 2 as the most appropriate meaning of "yell":

"Sense Number: 2 - Utter or declare in a very loud voice."

In the given context, the speaker is using "yell" to indicate that they are shouting or calling out something loudly, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. Specifically, the speaker is yelling at someone named Jess, which supports the usage of this sense.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, the best interpretation of "leap" in your sentence is:

Sense Number: 2 – Pass abruptly from one state or topic to another.

In this sense, "leap" means to transition suddenly from one idea or subject to another, without any intermediate steps or connections. In the context of your sentence, it seems that the speaker is moving quickly from discussing something else to mentioning their shoes, which fits with this definition of "leap".
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "wear" in the sentence you provided is:

Sense Number: 9 - Put clothing on one's body

In this sentence, the speaker is describing what they are wearing, specifically mentioning that they are wearing alligator loafers. Therefore, the sense of "wear" that refers to putting clothing on one's body is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "loafer," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - a low leather step-in shoe with a broad flat heel.

The context of the passage provides clear evidence that the speaker is referring to a type of footwear, as they mention being dressed in alligator loafers. Additionally, the phrase "step-in shoe" implies a specific type of design. While the other senses may be plausible in different contexts, the combination of these factors strongly supports the second definition of "loafer."
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "pilot" is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition given for this sense is: "someone who is licensed to operate an aircraft in flight". This fits well with the context of the sentence, where the pilot is lifting off in a plane. Additionally, this sense has the highest frequency among all the other senses provided, which further supports its selection.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'laugh' is:

    Sense Number: 1 - Definition: produce laughter
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about the possible senses of the word "burner," my answer would be:

"Sense Number: 2 - the heating elements of a stove or range on which pots and pans are placed for cooking."

This sense of "burner" makes the most sense in the given context because the phrase "fired up the burner" implies that something was ignited or heated using the heating elements of a stove or range, rather than an apparatus for burning fuel or refuse. Additionally, the fact that the text mentions lifting the object "a good 12-inches above the water level" further supports this interpretation, as it suggests that the heat from the burners was used to raise the object off the ground or surface.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would suggest that the best sense of "lift" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2
Definition: take hold of something and move it to a different location

The sentence "He moved up and lifted Jess's pistol out of its holster" clearly shows that the verb "lift" is being used to mean "take hold of something" and move it to a different location. This sense of the word aligns well with the context provided.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of 'scuttle', I would choose Sense Number 1: Definition-to move about or proceed hastily.

The reason for my choice is that in the given context, the verb 'scuttle' fits best with this definition. The phrase "we scuttled along for a few feet" implies a quick and sudden movement forward, which aligns with the meaning of moving about or proceeding hastily. Additionally, the fact that the author uses the past tense ("was") to describe the action of being in the dock suggests that the event occurred quickly, further supporting this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would choose sense number 2: "drop steeply". In the given sentence, "plunge" can be interpreted as dropping something steeply, such as falling into water. This sense is supported by the fact that it occurs frequently in many languages, including English.

So, "Sense Number: 2"
Response: 
Sense Number: 2
The word "come" in the given context most likely means "reach a destination; arrive by movement or progress." The sentence "The great, crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason" suggests that the speaker is describing the arrival of a large and impressive sight, which fits best with this sense of the word.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best sense of "rest" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Take a short break from one's activities in order to relax.

The context describes a situation where the speaker and their companion are taking a break from their journey to rest and relax in a soggy patch of field. The use of the phrase "scrambling out of the basket" and "safe for a little while" also supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of "have" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: have or possess, either in a concrete or an abstract sense Example: When negotiating with your union , do you make sure employees have a choice between new benefits and their cents per hour cost in wages .
Response: Sure! I have analyzed the given text and the available information about the five possible senses of the ambiguous word "pleasure". Based on my analysis, I believe the most appropriate sense of "pleasure" in this context is:

Sense Number: 2 - Something or someone that provides a source of happiness.

The evidence supporting this choice comes from the phrase "with a good deal of pleasure", which suggests that the speaker is referring to something that brings happiness or enjoyment. Additionally, the context of the passage mentions "the French half of our ballooning tag team scrambled in," which implies a positive and enjoyable experience. Given these factors, it seems likely that the speaker intended the term "pleasure" to refer to something enjoyable rather than a fundamental feeling or a formal expression.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of "scramble" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - climb awkwardly, as if by scrambling

In this context, the phrase "scrambling out of the basket into the mud" implies a physical action of climbing or ascending in an awkward manner, which aligns best with the definition of sense 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "half," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided for this sense matches the context of the sentence perfectly. In this sentence, "half" refers to one of two equal parts of something, specifically the two halves of their balloon team. Therefore, sense number 1 is the best fit.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best fit for the meaning of "scramble" in this sentence is:

Sense Number: 2 - climb awkwardly, as if by scrambling

In this context, the phrase "scrambling into the mud" implies a hasty and clumsy movement upwards or towards something, which fits well with the definition of sense 2. The other options do not seem to fit as well with the context of the sentence.
Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Based on the context you provided ("I looked at my watch"), the most appropriate sense of the verb "look" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense is "perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards". This fits well with the context of simply glancing at something, like checking the time on a watch.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would choose sense number 2 for "drive":

"Sense Number: 2 - travel or be transported in a vehicle."

This sense of "drive" fits best in the context of the passage because the author describes the group getting stuck in a ditch and needing help to get out, which implies they were using a vehicle to travel through the area.
Response: 
Sense Number: 1
The word "get" in the given sentence means "come into the possession of something concrete or abstract."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "get stuck" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Be unable to move further

The definition you provided fits well with the context of the sentence, where the speaker's vehicle became bogged down in a ditch and they had to seek help from a local farmer to extract it. The frequency count also supports this sense, as it mentions the word "bogged" which aligns with this sense.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the best fit for the sense of "enlist" in your given sentence is:

Sense Number: 2 - Hire for work or assistance

In this context, "enlist" means to hire someone for help with a particular task or problem. The phrase "enlisted the aid of a local farmer" suggests that the speaker needed someone's help to get out of the ditch, and they turned to a nearby resident for assistance.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of "aid" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - the activity of contributing to the fulfillment of a need or furtherance of an effort or purpose.

In this context, "aid" refers to the act of helping or supporting someone or something, which aligns with the definition of this sense of the word. The example sentence also supports this interpretation, as it describes how language was not a problem for Mr. Phillips because he could simply signal for help from nearby children who were able to provide assistance.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "farmer" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - a person who operates a farm.

The reason for this choice is that in the given sentence, the word "farmer" is used to describe someone who helped the speaker and their companions get out of a ditch. This aligns with the definition of a person who operates a farm, which is the first sense listed. Additionally, the phrase "local farmer" suggests that the person being referred to is someone who works on a small scale farm, rather than a larger commercial operation.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of "get out" in the given sentence is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense is: move out of or depart from. The example provided in the list matches well with the context of the sentence, where the speaker is describing their actions after getting stuck in a ditch.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of "hitch" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: a period of time spent in military service

In the given sentence, there is no obvious reference to anything related to vehicles or transportation, which eliminates senses 4 and 7. Additionally, the mention of "a local farmer" suggests a rural or agricultural setting, which aligns with sense 1 as it refers to a period of time spent in military service. Finally, the phrase "got stuck in a ditch" implies a sudden and unexpected obstacle, which fits well with sense 1's definition of an unforeseen obstacle.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of "pull_out" is:

    Sense Number: 2 - Bring, take, or pull out of a container or from under a cover.

This sense makes the most sense in the context of the sentence you provided, as it refers to pulling something out of a container or from under a cover. The other senses do not fit quite as well in the context of the sentence.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "rendezvous" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Meet at a rendezvous

The definition you provided matches well with the context, as the group of people watching the speakers disassemble their hot air balloon could be considered a meeting point or a location where they plan to meet. Additionally, the phrase "yanking the balloon to the ground," implies a deliberate action taken towards a specific destination, which further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "balloon," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - small thin inflatable rubber bag with narrow neck.

The context of the passage highlights the idea of manipulating and handling the balloon, which aligns better with the definition of a small, thin inflatable rubber bag. For instance, the author mentions "punching all the air out of it" and "cramming it and the basket into the trailer," which suggest actions that might be difficult or impossible to do with a large, rigid balloon. Additionally, the phrase "like a balloon would be pulled or pressed out of shape" further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "come" in this passage is:

Sense Number: 2 - "reach a destination; arrive by movement or progress".

The passage describes the group's journey towards their balloon, including the act of "yanking the balloon to the ground", "punching all the air out of it", and "cramming it and the basket into the trailer." These actions imply that the group arrived at the location where they were assembling their craft after moving towards it. Therefore, sense 2 best fits the context.
Response: Sure! I will help you determine the best sense for the word "rest" in the given context.

After analyzing the given examples and frequencies, I believe the most appropriate sense for the word "rest" in this context is:

Sense Number: 2 – Take a short break from one's activities in order to relax.

This sense of "rest" aligns well with the context described in the passage, where the speaker describes disassembling their hot air balloon after a flight and taking a moment to relax before continuing their journey. The use of the phrase "go in there" and "at least be safe for a little while" also supports this interpretation.

The other senses of "rest" do not fit as neatly in the context, either because they are less relevant to the action being described or because they do not convey the idea of taking a temporary break. For example, sense number 1 does not make much sense in this context since the speaker is not describing the balloon coming to rest in a specific location, nor are they referring to the act of not moving. Similarly, sense numbers 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10 do not appear to apply to the situation described in the passage.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the verb "watch" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Follow with the eyes or the mind.

This definition fits well with the context as the author describes observing the balloon being brought down and deflated, which involves following it with their eyes and likely also mentally tracking the process. The frequency count for this sense in the corpus is not specified, but it seems like a reasonable and common usage of the word in this situation.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "disassemble" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: take apart into its constituent pieces

This makes sense because the passage mentions "yanking the balloon to the ground," which implies breaking it down into smaller parts. Additionally, the phrase "punching all the air out of it" further supports this interpretation, as it would be difficult to do so if the balloon were still intact.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best sense of the word "craft" in this passage is:

Sense Number: 2 - a vehicle designed for navigation in or on water or air or through outer space.

The context describes the crew landing their hot air balloon on a dirt road near a group of people, and then disassembling and transporting the balloon and its basket in a trailer. This does not match any of the other defined senses of "craft," particularly senses 1 and 3, which refer to skilled practices or trades respectively. Instead, the mention of a "trailer" and the act of "yanking the balloon to the ground" suggest that the author intended the term "craft" to refer to a vehicle capable of navigating through the air or water.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "activity" is:

    Sense Number: 2 - The state of being active.

The definition you provided in the example matches well with the context where the term "activity" is used to describe the state of something happening or taking place. In this scenario, the author is describing the various actions taken after the balloon was brought down, such as disassembling it and storing it away. Therefore, the second sense of "activity," defined as the state of being active, seems like the best fit.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "include" is:

Sense Number: 2 - Consider as part of something

In this context, the author uses "include" to refer to the idea of considering a particular group of people as part of a larger whole. For instance, when describing the spread of a certain concept across different regions, the author notes that the groups being referred to are diverse and distinct from each other, but still inclusive of others. Therefore, sense 2 best captures the meaning intended by the author.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "routine" in the given passage is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: an unvarying or habitual method or procedure

The context of the passage suggests that the author is referring to a regular or typical process or series of actions that are performed in a particular situation or setting. The phrase "the whole thing, his manner conveyed, was so far outside the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded being swept under the rug" implies that what happened was not something that typically occurs or is expected to happen. Therefore, sense number 1 best captures the meaning of the word "routine" in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'yank' in this situation is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: pull, or move with a sudden movement.

This sense makes sense in the context of the passage because when the author says "Jess wasted a few seconds trying to yank them loose," it implies that she is using some force to pull something away or remove it. It fits well with the overall meaning of the sentence and the actions described within it.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the verb "punch" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Drive forcibly as if by a punch.

In this sentence, the author describes the action of dropping down from a plane and driving through the air towards a specific location, using language that evokes the idea of something being struck or punched forward. This sense of "punch" aligns well with the physical action described in the sentence, and fits the meaning of the word better than the other two possibilities.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "air" in this case is:

    Sense Number: 2 – the region above the ground.

The context describes the action of bringing a balloon down to earth and disassembling it, which suggests that the speaker is referring to the air as the space above the ground. Additionally, the examples provided in the possible senses do not fit well with the other options, especially since there is no mention of breathing, a distinctive quality, or any reference to Empedocles' theory of the elemental nature of air.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "roll_up" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Get or gather together.

In the given context, the phrase "rolled up the balloon" implies that something was gathered or collected, which fits best with the definition of sense 2. The other options do not seem to fit the context as well, especially since there is no indication of any physical manipulation of the balloon.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "cram" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - put something somewhere so that the space is completely filled

In the given context, the author describes the process of "yank[ing] the balloon to the ground," "puncht[ing] all the air out of it," and then "roll[ing] it up and cram[ing] it and the basket into the trailer." These actions suggest that the author is using "cram" to mean fill something to capacity, such as filling a trailer with the deflated balloon and its basket.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word "basket" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: a container that is usually woven and has handles

The context mentions handling the balloon and trailer, which aligns with the definition of a basket as a container that is typically woven and has handles. The other senses do not fit as well in the context, especially since there is no mention of any vertical structure (as in Sense Number 3) or scoring in basketball (as in Sense Number 4).
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "exercise," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for this sense matches the meaning of the word in the context of the sentence: "It was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole." The sentence implies that the speaker and others had engaged in physical activity earlier in the day, which aligns with the definition of "exercise" as any bodily movement done to sustain or improve one's health.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of "have" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: have or possess, either in a concrete or an abstract sense

In this sentence, "it was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole," the word "have" implies possession or ownership of some kind, which fits best with definition 1.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word 'follow' in the sentence is:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: to travel behind, go after, come after

In this sentence, 'follow' likely means to come after or go after something, as the context implies that the speaker and others had just had some exercise and are now heading towards a nearby watering hole. This sense of 'follow' fits best with the grammatical structure of the sentence and the overall meaning of the text.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "drive" is sense number 2: "travel or be transported in a vehicle". In this context, the phrase "it was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole" implies that the speaker and others were traveling in a vehicle after exercising in the morning. Therefore, the sense related to traveling or being transported in a vehicle makes the most sense in this case.

So, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'mean', I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 – Have as a logical consequence

In the given sentence, the author mentions watching French duffers at the golf course while sitting under Cinzano umbrellas, and also mentioning that they are nursing an espresso and their ego. This implies that the author is using the word 'mean' to indicate a logical consequence or outcome, rather than any other sense. For instance, it could be inferred that the author means that the act of drinking an espresso and nursing their ego while watching others play golf is a natural or expected outcome after a long day at work. Therefore, sense number 2 best captures the intended meaning of the author in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would identify the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "return" as:

Sense Number: 2 – Give back

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense, as the author mentions "their ego" after mentioning they are nursing an espresso, suggesting that they are referring to themselves in the first person plural. Additionally, the phrase "give back" is a common idiomatic expression that fits well with the context of the sentence.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the verb "watch" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Follow with the eyes or the mind.

The definition matches the context as it refers to observing something with one's mind rather than just seeing it physically. The phrase "Are you watching work schedules..." implies that the speaker is not only aware of the schedules but also actively thinking about them and paying attention to them.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "duffer" is:

Sense Number: 1 - an incompetent or clumsy person

The context of the passage mentions watching French people play golf, which aligns with the definition of "duffer" as someone who is incompetent or clumsy at golf. Additionally, the reference to the speaker nursing an espresso and their ego suggests a level of self-awareness and humor, which is consistent with the idea of mocking oneself for being a poor golfer.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "maul" is:

Sense Number: 2 – Injure badly by beating.

In the given context, the phrase "French duffers mauling the first tee" implies a violent action against someone or something, which aligns with the definition of "injuring badly by beating." Additionally, the mention of being under an umbrella and nursing an espresso suggest a relaxed atmosphere, which does not seem to fit with the idea of splitting wood with a maul and wedges (sense number 1).
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "tee" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: the starting place for each hole on a golf course

The context of the passage mentions watching French duffers hit balls from the tee, which implies that it refers to the starting point of each hole on a golf course. Additionally, the mention of Cinzano umbrellas and espresso suggest a setting related to golf, further supporting this interpretation. There are no examples provided for senses 2 or 3, which also supports the conclusion that sense 1 is the most likely meaning in this context.
Response: 
"Sense Number: 2"

The context of the given passage strongly suggests that the author intended the word "sit" to mean "be around, often idly or without specific purpose." This sense is supported by the mention of people sitting under umbrellas while watching others play golf, with no clear indication of any particular purpose or activity. Additionally, the phrase "sat on split bamboo mats" suggests a relaxed and informal atmosphere, consistent with the idea of simply being present in a location rather than engaging in any specific action.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the meaning of "ego" is sense number 2: "your consciousness of your own identity".

The phrase "me nursing an espresso and my ego" suggests that the speaker is referring to themselves, their consciousness or self-awareness, rather than any kind of inflated pride or superiorsity. Additionally, the reference to "Cinzano umbrellas" and "watching a few French duffers" implies a casual, everyday setting, which further supports the idea that the speaker is using "ego" to refer to their personal identity.

Therefore, I conclude that the most appropriate sense of "ego" in this context is sense number 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "figure" is:

Sense Number: 1

The sentence "Still , I figured the event 's envy- quotient back in the U.S.A. was near peerless." implies that the speaker is using "figure" to mean "judge to be probable". This sense is supported by the fact that the frequency of this sense of "figure" is higher than any other sense in the provided corpus (986 hits), and it matches well with the meaning of the sentence.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "clamber" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided fits well with the context of the sentence, where the speaker is describing how the French-speaking passengers climbed into the chase car after the pilot. The phrase "climbing awkwardly" matches the physical action described in the sentence, and the mention of loose dirt flying behind them adds a sense of urgency and difficulty to the act of climbing. Overall, it seems like the best fit for the context and available information.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "leave" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - go and leave behind, either intentionally or by neglect or forgetfulness.

This sense fits well with the context because the speaker and their companion are left to ride in an alfresco wicker basket, suggesting that they may have intentionally or accidentally left something behind.
Response: 
"Sense Number: 2"

The given context and examples suggest that the best fit for the ambiguous word "ride" in this passage is sense number 2, which defines the verb as "be carried or travel on or in a vehicle." In this case, "My American companion and I were left to ride alfresco in the wicker basket," implies that the speaker and their companion were carrying or traveling in a vehicle, specifically an open basket, rather than sitting on or controlling an animal, moving like a floating object, continuing undisturbed, having certain properties when driven, lying moored or anchored, climbing up on the body, keeping partially engaged by slightly depressing a pedal with the foot, or copulating with something.
Response: Streak means to move rapidly in a direct path. Therefore, Sense Number: 1
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of the word "resist" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2

This sense of "resist" means to stand up or offer resistance to someone or something. In the context of your sentence, it seems that the speaker is using the verb "resist" to indicate their intention to defy or oppose the gendarme's actions, rather than simply eluding them or withstanding a physical force. Therefore, sense number 2 is the best fit for the given context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose Sense Number: 2, "bring up".

In the given sentence, "rear" can be interpreted as bringing something up, such as rearing a child or raising a animal. This sense aligns well with the context, where the speaker is described as standing up on their hind legs and saluting. Therefore, the second sense of "rear" is the most appropriate choice.

Here is my response in the requested format:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "salute", I believe that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 – Greet in a friendly way

In the given context, the author uses the word "salute" to describe how a fresh breeze greets someone, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. This sense is also supported by the fact that there are no examples provided for any other senses in the given text, which suggests that the author intended to convey a friendly greeting rather than any other meaning of the word.
