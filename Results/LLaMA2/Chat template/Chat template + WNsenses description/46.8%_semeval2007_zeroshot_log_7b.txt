The high frequency of this sense (327) supports this interpretation, as it suggests that this meaning of "become" is widely used and common. The example sentence provided ("He became annoyed when he heard the bad news") also supports this choice, as it shows how the verb can be used to describe someone entering a particular emotional state.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'cause', I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate meaning.

"Sense Number: 1"

In the sentence "The `causes` of homelessness are poorly understood and complex in any individual case," the word "understand" refers to having knowledge and comprehension of something, which aligns with the first definition provided. Additionally, the frequency of this sense in a large corpus of texts supports its selection as the most probable interpretation in this instance (110 vs. the others).
Response: Sure! I can help with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'quote', I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate meaning:

"Sense Number: 1 - Definition: repeat a passage from; Frequency: 30; Example: He quoted the Bible to her."

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense, as it refers to repeating something that was previously stated or written. Additionally, the fact that there are 30 occurrences of this sense in a large corpus of texts supports its likelihood as the primary meaning of the word in this instance.

Sense Number: 2 - To give extra weight to (a communication)

The context suggests that the speaker is highlighting the importance of something, which aligns with the definition of this sense of "emphasize". The fact that it occurs only once in the corpus also supports this interpretation, as it implies that the speaker is using the term in a specific way to convey added significance.
Response: Sense Number: 2: Notice or perceive.

In the given context, the best fit for the ambiguous word "note" is sense #2, "notice or perceive." This definition fits well with the idea of observing or recognizing something, which aligns with the meaning conveyed by the phrase "had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse."

This sense has a higher frequency than some of the other options, with 28 instances in the corpus of texts provided. Here is an example sentence using this sense:

"The Spanish people were known for their rich culture and heritage."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "examine," I would choose sense number 2: "observe, check out, and look over carefully or inspect."

The usage of "examine" in the context you provided aligns best with this definition, which fits well with the idea of looking at something closely or checking it out to determine its details or condition. In particular, the phrase "had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse" implies a thorough inspection or observation of the individuals being discussed, rather than simply considering them in detail or analyzing them. Therefore, sense number 2 seems like the most suitable choice.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the verb "have" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - have as a feature

In this context, the author is mentioning that the homeless people they examined had a multitude of physical disorders in addition to their psychiatric problems and substance abuse, which suggests that the word "have" is being used to indicate possession or belonging.

This sense is supported by the mention of various health issues such as malnutrition, chest diseases, cardiovascular disorders, skin problems, infectious diseases, and the aftereffects of assaults and rape. These conditions can all result in physical harm or injury that would fall under the category of "suffering."

Additionally, the frequency of this sense in the corpus data (17) supports its selection as the most likely interpretation in this context. The example provided further reinforces this choice, as it mentions someone experiencing an injury.

Therefore, the answer is: Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides evidence that the word "people" refers to the body of citizens of a state or country.

The frequency of this sense of the word (28) supports its selection as the most appropriate interpretation in this case.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word "lack," I would choose Sense Number: 1.

"Sense Number: 1"

The definition of this sense of "lack" fits well with the context of the passage, which describes the various ways in which homeless people are deprived of basic necessities like food, hygiene, and medical care. The phrase "This soup lacks salt" provides a clear example of how this sense of "lack" could be used in this context. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (31) is higher than any other option, indicating that it is the most commonly used meaning of "lack" in this situation.

The phrase "lack the elementary necessities" supports this interpretation, as it implies a broader range of essential needs beyond just physical protection.

Furthermore, according to the frequency statistics provided, Sense Number 1 has the highest occurrence among all the listed senses, which further supports its selection as the most likely meaning in this context.

Therefore, my answer is:

Sense Number: 1
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. After analyzing the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'lack', my answer would be:

"Sense Number: 1: Definition-be without
Frequency: 31
Example: This soup lacks salt"

The first sense of 'lack' fits best in the context provided because it means "to be without something necessary or expected". In this case, the author is stating that homeless people lack basic necessities such as food, hygiene, and medical care, which aligns well with the definition of "be without". Additionally, the frequency of this sense is relatively high, indicating its common usage in English language.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. After analyzing the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word " necessity" , I would choose Sense Number: 2.

The definition of this sense fits well with the context provided : "Anything indispensable". In this case, the author argues that homeless people lack even the most fundamental necessities of life such as food, shelter, and basic healthcare which highlights how important these things are for survival. Therefore, the second definition of " necessity" which refers to something indispensable aligns better with the intended meaning in the given context.

Here is the breakdown of why I chose this answer:

* Definition: matches the context (indispensable)
* Frequency: 7 (more common usage)
* Example: food and shelter are necessities of life (illustrates the concept clearly)
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word 'point_out', my answer would be:

The phrase "a state of difficulty that needs to be resolved" accurately captures the idea that these problems require attention and action to address them effectively. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (151) is higher than the other two options, which further supports my choice.
Response: Sure! I can help with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "predispose," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number 1: Make susceptible."

The definition of this sense aligns well with the context provided in the passage, where the author mentions that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness. It also matches the example provided, which states that this illness predisposes someone to gain weight. Additionally, according to the frequency information provided, this sense of the word occurs more frequently than the other two options, indicating its likelihood as the primary meaning in this context.
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "category," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1 - A collection of things sharing a common attribute.

The definition given for this sense matches well with the context provided, where the author is discussing different categories of health problems that may lead to homelessness. In this case, the term "category" refers to a group of health issues that share a common characteristic, such as lack of adequate shelter.

Additionally, the frequency of this sense in a large corpus of texts also supports this interpretation, as it is mentioned that this sense occurs 17 times.

Here is an example sentence from the context that illustrates the use of this sense: "There are three categories of mental illnesses: those that can be treated with medication, those that require therapy, and those that cannot be treated."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "compose" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Form the substance of

The definition provided fits well with the meaning of the sentence you provided, as the author is discussing how certain factors can contribute to a person becoming homeless. The phrase "form the substance of" implies the idea of something being made up or constituted from its individual parts, which aligns with the concept of understanding how different elements can lead to homelessness. Additionally, the frequency count supports this interpretation, as sense #1 has a higher frequency than any other option (14 vs 5-4-3-1).
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would choose Sense Number 1: "be without".

Here's why: In the context of the passage, the phrase "lacks" makes sense when interpreted as "being without something", which aligns with the definition of Sense 1. Specifically, the phrase "This soup lacks salt" implies that the soup does not have enough salt, which is consistent with the meaning of being without salt.

Furthermore, according to the frequency information provided, Sense 1 has the highest frequency among all the possible senses, indicating that it is the most commonly used sense of the word "lack" in this context.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 1"
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'shelter', I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate meaning:

"Sense Number: 1 - a structure that provides privacy and protection from danger."

The context of the passage highlights the importance of providing safe and secure shelter, which aligns well with the definition of sense number 1. Additionally, the phrase "they were huddled together for protection" in the example supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about the different senses of the word "interaction," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 1 - a mutual or reciprocal action; interacting"

This definition matches the meaning of the word in the context of the passage you provided. The author is discussing the complexity of the relationship between health and homelessness, suggesting that there is no single cause or effect, but rather a multifaceted interaction between these two factors. Therefore, the first sense of "interaction" which refers to a mutual or reciprocal action fits best in this context.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "defy," I would choose sense number 1: "resist or confront with resistance."

Here's why: In the given context, the author is trying to convey that the relationship between health and homelessness is complicated and cannot be reduced to simple causes or effects. The phrase "defy" fits well in this context because it implies a resistance or opposition to easy explanations or predictions. Sense number 1 captures this meaning best, with examples like "The politician defied public opinion" suggesting someone actively rejecting or opposing prevailing views.

In contrast, senses 2 and 3 do not quite fit as well in this context. While sense 2 could imply a lack of explanation or understanding (e.g., "This behavior defies explanation"), sense 3 (challenge) does not capture the nuance of the author's statement.

Therefore, my answer is:

Sense Number: 1
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context you provided best fits with sense number 2 of "generalization," which refers to an idea or conclusion having general application. In the given passage, the author is highlighting that the relationship between health and homelessness cannot be reduced to simple generalizations, suggesting that there are many factors at play and no easy answers. Therefore, the second sense of "generalization" seems most applicable here.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'look_to', I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate meaning.

The definition of sense number 1 is "turn one's interests or expectations towards". This sense makes the most sense in the context of the sentence "If we look to the future, preventing homelessness is an important objective." As the sentence implies, looking to the future means turning one's attention or focus towards it, which aligns with the first sense of 'look_to'.

Additionally, according to the frequency information provided, sense number 1 occurs 4 times more often than sense number 2 in a large corpus of texts, further supporting its selection as the most likely meaning in this context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. After analyzing the context and the available information, I would choose sense number 2 as the best fit for the word "prevent" in the given sentence.

Here's why: In the sentence "If we look to the future, preventing homelessness is an important objective," the verb "prevent" is used to indicate action taken before something happens. Specifically, it means stopping or hindering something from occurring. Therefore, sense number 2 fits best because it defines "prevent" as "stop (someone or something) from doing something or being in a certain state."

So, my answer is: Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context you provided best fits with the second definition of "require" which means "consider obligatory; request and expect". In this sentence, "developing a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness" implies that it is necessary or important to have such an understanding, which aligns with the meaning of "require" in this sense. Additionally, the phrase "can be developed only through careful study and research" further supports this interpretation, as it emphasizes the idea that effort and resources must be put into studying and learning about homelessness in order to gain a deeper understanding.
Response: Sense Number: 2
Develop in this context most likely refers to the definition “work out” which has a frequency score of 44. The given sentence highlights the need for a deeper understanding of homelessness, suggesting that developing such knowledge requires effort and time. Therefore, the best match among the provided options is the sense of working out or solving a problem, which aligns well with the overall meaning of the sentence.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The context of the sentence you provided best fits sense number one of "understanding," which refers to the cognitive state of having knowledge or insight into something. In this case, the speaker is expressing the need to develop a deeper understanding of homelessness, implying that they do not have a full grasp of its complexities yet.
Response: Sure! I am happy to help with your request. Based on the given context and the available information, the best fit for the sense of "possess" in this case would be:

Sense Number: 2 - Have ownership or possession of
Response: Sense Number: 2
Develop: Work out

The context of the given passage suggests that the author is using the word "develop" in the sense of working out or solving a problem. The phrase "a much more sophisticated understanding of the dynamics of homelessness" implies that there is a need to develop a deeper comprehension of the issue, which aligns with the sense of "work out." Additionally, the frequency of this sense (44) is higher than any other sense listed, further supporting this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of the word "study" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – applying the mind to learning and understanding a subject (especially by reading)

This sense of the word aligns well with the context provided, as it mentions a detailed critical inspection of a topic, which fits with the definition of "applying the mind to learning and understanding." Additionally, the frequency of this sense (17) is higher than any other option, indicating that it is the most commonly used meaning of the word in this context.
Response: Sure! After analyzing the given context and the list of possible senses for the ambiguous word "say," I would suggest the following answer:

"Sense Number: 1 - Definition: express in words."

The reason for choosing this sense is that the context highlights the speaker's ability to express their thoughts and ideas through language. The phrase "a study by Tulane Prof. James Wright says" implies a formal and academic setting, where precise language usage is crucial. Moreover, the sentence "He said that he wanted to marry her" clearly shows the verb "said" being used to convey someone's spoken words. Therefore, sense number 1, which defines "say" as "express in words," best fits the context and the frequency distribution provided.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would choose Sense Number 2: "applying the mind to learning and understanding a subject (especially by reading)" as the best fit for the ambiguous word "study". This definition matches well with the meaning conveyed in the context, where the passage discusses the findings of a study, which implies a thorough examination and analysis of data or information. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (17) is higher than any other option, indicating its relative commonness in English language usage.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word "show" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: give an exhibition of to an interested audience

This sense of the word makes the most sense in the given context because it aligns with how the phrase "the study shows" could be interpreted. It implies that the study provides evidence or demonstrates something interesting or noteworthy about the topic being discussed.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The context of the passage suggests that when the author says "make up," they are using the first definition of the phrase, which means "form or compose." This sense is supported by the fact that the author mentions that nearly 40% of the homeless population consists of women and children, and that only 25% of them exhibit drug, alcohol, and mental problems. The use of the phrase "make up" in this context implies that the author is referring to composing or forming something, such as a group of people or a statistic.
Response: Sense Number: 2

In the given context, the best fit for the ambiguous word "exhibit" is sense number 2, which means "to show, make visible or apparent." This definition matches the meaning of the phrase "only 25% of the homeless exhibit some combination of drug, alcohol, and mental problems," as it implies showing or making evident the presence of these issues among the homeless population.

The other senses do not fit as well in the context. Sense number 1 does not seem relevant here, as there is no mention of displaying any attributes, properties, knowledge, or skills. Sense number 3 could potentially apply if the author was using the term "exhibit" to mean "give an exhibition of," but without further information, it cannot be determined whether this is the intended meaning. Finally, sense number 4 is completely irrelevant to the context and should be dismissed.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "combination" in the given sentence is:

Sense Number: 4 - a group of people (often temporary) having a common purpose

In the given sentence, the term "combination" refers to a group of individuals who share a common goal, specifically the percentage of women and children among the homeless population compared to those with drug, alcohol, and mental problems. Therefore, sense number 4 best captures the meaning of the word in this context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with identifying the correct sense of the ambiguous word "problem" based on the given context and possible senses. After analyzing the information provided, my answer is:

Sense Number: 1 – Definition: a state of difficulty that needs to be resolved

The frequency of this sense of "problem" in the given corpus is 151, which suggests that it is the most commonly used sense in the context provided. The example sentence also supports this choice as it refers to "she and her husband are having problems." This sense of "problem" fits best in the context of Dr. Wright's statement about homelessness being variously a housing, employment, demographic, etc., issue.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word 'create' is sense number 2: "bring into existence". This sense aligns well with the meaning conveyed in the passage, which describes various ways in which homelessness has been caused or brought about, such as through cutbacks in social welfare spending, the decline of the traditional nuclear family, etc. The frequency of this sense (38) also supports its selection, as it seems to be the most common usage of the word in this context. Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sense Number: 1

The context you provided best fits with the first definition of "result" which means "issue or terminate (in a specified way, state, etc.)". In this passage, the word "result" can be seen as referring to the outcome or conclusion that arises from the various factors mentioned by Dr. Wright. For instance, the phrase "a problem created by the cutbacks in social welfare spending" implies that there may be negative consequences or results if such cutbacks occur. Therefore, option 1 best captures the intended meaning of the author.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given context best fits sense number 2, "make a logical or causal connection." In this context, Dr. Wright is attempting to link various issues (homelessness, housing problems, etc.) using logic and cause-and-effect relationships, rather than referring to physical connections between objects or people. Therefore, sense number 2 is the most suitable choice.
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context given describes Dr. Wright using various ways that people can experience difficulties with housing, work, and other aspects of their lives. Given these multiple meanings, it seems likely that when Dr. Wright says "people live," they are referring to leading a particular way of life, which aligns with definition #2. According to the frequency information, this sense of "live" occurs 51 times in the corpus, suggesting that it is not as rare or specialized as some of the other senses but still less common than many uses of the term.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "quote" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: repeat a passage from

In the given sentence, the speaker is repeating something that was said by someone else, which aligns with the definition of this sense of "quote". The high frequency count also supports this interpretation, as it suggests that this sense of the word is commonly used in everyday language.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The definition given in sense number 2 fits best with the context of the passage. The phrase "director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless" implies that the speaker is referring to a member of a board of directors rather than someone who supervises actors or makes films. Additionally, there are no examples provided for senses 3, 4, or 5 that relate to the context of the passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the best definition of "center" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: an area that is approximately central within some larger region.

This sense makes the most sense in the given context because the speaker is referring to a location that is central within the city of New York, where the drop-in center for the homeless is located.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "sleep," I would choose sense number 1: Definition: be asleep. Here's why:

Sense Number: 1

The sentence provided in the context clearly implies that the speaker is referring to the act of being asleep, as the director mentions that they are afraid of being robbed or murdered while they are sleeping. This sense of the word is also supported by its high frequency of occurrence in a large corpus of texts, which suggests that it is a common and widely used meaning of the term. For instance, there are many sentences like "I didn't get much sleep last night" or "She loves her afternoon nap." Therefore, I believe that the best interpretation of the ambiguity in the context is that the speaker means "be asleep."
Response: Sure! I can help with that. Based on the context given, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'rob' is:

"Sense Number: 1"

In this context, the speaker is quoting a director of a privately funded drop-in center for the homeless in New York who said if one is homeless, they don't sleep for fear of being robbed or murdered. In this situation, the sense of rob that refers to taking something away by force or without the consent of the owner is the most relevant. Therefore, the answer is Sense Number 1 with a frequency of 5.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the available information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "fend" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for this sense matches the context perfectly. In the given sentence, it seems that the speaker is describing someone who is struggling to cope with the consequences of sleep deprivation and is no longer able to function normally. Therefore, the sense of "fend" that fits best here is the one where it means "try to manage without help."
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, the best fit for the ambigious word "have" is sense number 2: "Have as a feature". This sense is supported by the fact that the sentence mentions the existence of mental illness or addiction among some of the homeless population, which aligns with the definition of having a particular characteristic or feature. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (377) is higher than any other option, indicating that it is the most commonly used sense of "have" in this context.

So, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses of the ambiguous word 'addiction', I would choose Sense Number: 1 as the best fit.

The definition you provided for Sense Number 1 fits well with the context of the sentence, which mentions some of the homeless people having pre-existing mental illness or addiction. The phrase "being abnormally tolerant to and dependent on something" aligns with the idea of dependence on substances like alcohol or narcotic drugs, which are known to be harmful and can lead to addiction. Therefore, it seems the most likely sense of 'addiction' in this context.

Here's my response in the requested format:

"Sense Number: 1"
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the best sense of "fall" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - move downward and lower, but not necessarily all the way

The sentence "Many others have fallen through cracks in the economy into the grim, brutal world of our city streets" implies that the subject has moved downward and lower, but not necessarily all the way, which aligns with the second definition of "fall".
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context provided, the best sense of "dismiss" in this case is:

    Sense Number: 2 – Cease to consider; put out of judicial consideration.

The frequency of this sense in the given corpus supports its interpretation in the context of the passage, where the author argues that reducing federal housing assistance programs may have contributed to the increase in homelessness during the Reagan-Bush era. The phrase "dismiss as sentimental" implies that the author does not want to acknowledge or give credence to this idea, which aligns with the second definition of "dismiss."
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides evidence for the second definition of "view" which refers to the visual percept of a region. The sentence mentions the reduced federal housing assistance programs and its impact on people sleeping on the street, indicating that the writer is discussing a specific geographical area or location. Therefore, the sense of "view" that fits best in this context is definition 2, which refers to the visual percept of a region.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word 'reduction', I would say that the most appropriate sense for the context is:

"Sense Number: 1 - Definition: the act of decreasing or reducing something".

This is because the context mentions the reduction of federal housing-assistance programs by 77%, which aligns with the first definition of 'reduction' as the act of decreasing or reducing something. Additionally, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the other two definitions of 'reduction' apply in this context. Therefore, option 1 is the best fit.
Response: Sense Number: 2
The word 'play' in the given sentence can be interpreted as "act or have an effect in a specified way or with a specific outcome". This sense is supported by the phrase "the reduced federal housing-assistance programs" which implies that the speaker believes that the government's actions had a significant impact on the situation described.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "role," I would suggest the third sense:

"Role: Sense Number 3 (what something is used for)

The definition of this sense is: what something is used for; the function or purpose of something."

This sense fits well with the context of the passage, where the author is discussing the potential impact of reduced federal housing assistance programs on the homeless population. In this context, the word "role" could be referring to the intended or actual function of these programs, rather than the actions or activities assigned to a specific individual or group.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would choose Sense Number 2: "a concept of quantity involving zero and units" as the best fit for the ambiguous word "number".

The context provides evidence for this choice because it mentions "the reduced number of federal housing-assistance programs", which suggests that the speaker is referring to a specific quantity or amount rather than a general idea or group of things. Additionally, the definition of Sense 2 aligns with the meaning of the phrase "every number has a unique position in the sequence," which implies a quantifiable and measurable aspect of numbers.

Therefore, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 1

The correct interpretation of the word "woman" in the given context is sense number 1, which refers to an adult female person (as opposed to a man). This is evident from the fact that the sentence mentions the reduced federal housing assistance programs affecting homeless individuals, including both men and women. Therefore, the author is likely referring to any adult female person, regardless of her relationship status or occupation.

The other senses do not fit well in the context. For instance, sense number 2 refers to a female person playing a significant role in a man's life, but there is no such information provided in the sentence. Similarly, sense number 3 does not make sense in the context because there is no mention of a specific person being employed to do housework. And finally, sense number 4 is irrelevant to the discussion about the impact of federal housing assistance programs on homelessness.
Response: Sure! Based on the context provided, I believe the best fit for the meaning of "bother" in this sentence is:

Sense Number: 2 - cause annoyance in; disturb, especially by minor irritations

The speaker seems to be suggesting that the idea that mental illness and substance abuse are causes of homelessness may be causing some annoyance or distress, which aligns with the second definition of "bother". The frequency of this sense in the corpus data also supports this interpretation, as it is mentioned 16 times.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The best fit for the given context is sense number 2, which defines "consider" as giving careful consideration to something. In the context of the passage, the author is arguing against the idea that mental illness and substance abuse are solely causes of homelessness, and instead considers the possibility that they may be consequences. Therefore, the use of "consider" in this context aligns well with this definition.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word "research," I would choose sense number 2 as the most appropriate definition:

"Sense Number: 2 - Definition: a search for knowledge."
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "stop" is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense is: come to a halt, stop moving. This sense is the most likely choice because it fits best with the meaning of the sentence given. The other senses do not quite fit as well, especially since there is no indication of movement or change in location in the sentence.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word 'assertion', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 1"

The definition of this sense fits well with the context provided: "a declaration that is made emphatically (as if no supporting evidence were necessary)". In this context, the speaker is suggesting that the research was halted because a conclusive statement could be made without needing any further proof or evidence. This sense of the word 'assertion' aligns best with the meaning of the sentence provided.
Response: 
Sense Number: 1
The given text fits best with the definition of "engage in" as the meaning of "make". The phrase "make a mess in one's office" supports this interpretation, as it implies creating a state of disarray or chaos.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "march" in this case is sense number 2: "the act of marching; walking with regular steps (especially in a procession of some kind)".

The context clearly implies that the speaker is referring to a physical movement or action involving a group of people walking together, which aligns well with the definition of sense number 2. For instance, the phrase "it was a long march" suggests a continuous journey or walk over a distance, which fits well with the idea of people moving forward in a coordinated manner. Additionally, the mention of the event taking place in Washington further supports this interpretation, as it is likely that the participants were gathered together and walked through the city as part of the demonstration. Therefore, sense number 2 seems like the most suitable choice for the given text.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the passage suggests that the speaker is using the verb "choose" in the second sense, which means "select as an alternative over another." This sense is supported by the phrase "insinuating that the march got its major support from self-serving groups that `know a good thing when they see it`", which implies that the speaker is suggesting that some groups were chosen specifically because they had their own interests at heart rather than the cause of the homeless. The frequency of this sense (19) also supports this interpretation, as it is more common to use "choose" in this way than the other two senses offered.
Response: Sure! I can help you determine the correct meaning of the word "cite" in the given context. After analyzing the information provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of "cite" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Make reference to.

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for this interpretation, as the speaker is referring to specific organizations as examples of those who supported the march. The phrase "mentioned in connection with" reinforces this sense, as it implies a direct link between the two entities being discussed. According to the frequency count provided, this sense of "cite" occurs 13 times in a large corpus of texts, which supports its likelihood as the primary meaning in this situation.
Response: Sure! I can help with that. Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "group" is:

    Sense Number: 1 - Any number of entities (members) considered as a unit.

The definition and frequency information you provided match well with this sense, which refers to a collection of individuals or things regarded as a single entity. In the given context, the author seems to be referring to various organizations or companies that supported the march, so sense 1 is the most suitable choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "insinuate" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 – Definition: introduce or insert oneself in a subtle manner.

The context of the passage suggests that the author is accusing certain organizations of using their influence to manipulate others for personal gain. The phrase "insinuated themselves" implies a subtle and underhanded approach, which aligns with the first definition of "insinuate". Additionally, the lack of any evidence to suggest that these organizations were directly involved in the march supports this interpretation.
Response: Sense Number: 1
The word "get" in the given sentence means "come into the possession of something concrete or abstract".
Response: Support in the given context refers to sense #2 which defines "aiding the cause or policy or interests of". In the passage, the author implies that the organizations mentioned provide financial support to the march for the benefit of their own interests rather than out of altruism. Therefore, the usage of "support" aligns best with definition #2.

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 1
The sense of "know" in the given context is #1, which means "be cognizant or aware of a fact or a specific piece of information; possess knowledge or information about". This sense is the most relevant in the context because the author is accusing certain organizations of using their influence to support the march for personal gain, rather than out of genuine concern for the issue.
Response: Sense Number: 4 (artifact)

The context of the passage suggests that by "thing" the author means some kind of physical object or tool, possibly related to construction or building. The mention of specific organizations such as the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen supports this interpretation, as these groups are likely to be involved in the creation or production of materials or tools related to their respective fields. Additionally, the author's suggestion that the march was motivated by greed or the profit motive also fits with the idea of "thing" referring to a material object with value.
Response: Sense Number: 1
The given context best fits sense number 1 of "see," which means "perceive by sight or have the power to perceive by sight." This sense is supported by the phrase "You have to be a good observer to see all the details" in the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "crusade" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for this sense fits well with the context of the passage, where the author is accusing certain organizations of using the march for the homeless as a way to promote their own interests rather than truly helping those in need. The phrase "know a good thing when they see it" also supports this interpretation, suggesting that the author believes these groups are motivated by self-interest rather than altruism.
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word 'force' in this case is sense number 2: (physics) the influence that produces a change in a physical quantity.

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for this interpretation, as it mentions the desire to subscribe to and advertise in a newspaper, which implies a commercial or financial motivation. This sense of 'force' aligns well with the idea of influencing a physical quantity, such as the motion of an object, which is a fundamental concept in physics.

Here is my answer in the requested format:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambigious word "subscribe" is:

    Sense Number: 2 - Mark with one's signature; write one's name (on)

The context of the sentence "But isn't the desire for profit the driving force behind those who subscribe to, and advertise in, your paper?" implies that the speaker is referring to the act of signing up or registering for something, which aligns best with the second definition of "subscribe".
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "advertise" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Make publicity for; try to sell (a product)

In this context, the speaker is suggesting that the person being referred to is actively promoting or selling something, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. The frequency count also supports this interpretation, as it shows that this sense of the word is more common than the other option.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "mention," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 2 - make mention of"

In the given context, the speaker seems to be asking why certain non-profit organizations were not mentioned during the march, which aligns best with the definition of "make mention of." The frequency of this sense (14) also supports this choice, as it suggests that this meaning of "mention" is relatively common in written language.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'organization', I would choose sense number 2 as the most appropriate.

The definition of sense number 2, "an organized structure for arranging or classifying", fits best with the context of the passage. The speaker is questioning why the writer didn't mention various non-profit organizations that were involved in a march, which aligns with the meaning of 'organization' as a structured system for categorizing or grouping things. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (12) is higher than any of the other options, indicating that it is the most commonly used meaning of the word in this context.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2".
Response: Sure! I can help with that. Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, the most appropriate sense of "participate" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Become a participant; be involved in.

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense as it mentions various organizations that took part in the march, indicating that the speaker expects the listener to understand the sense of participation in becoming involved in the event.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "homeless" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – poor people who unfortunately do not have a home to live in.

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense because it mentions a specific group of people (the 203 Baltimore homeless) who are lacking housing. Additionally, the term "homeless" has been used historically to refer to individuals who are living without permanent residence or shelter, which aligns with definition 2.

Therefore, out of the two possible senses provided, sense number 2 is the best fit for the given context and information.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "undergo" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Pass Through

The definition provided for this sense matches the context of the sentence, where the writer is suggesting conducting one's own survey rather than relying solely on the findings from the previous study. The phrase "pass through" implies movement or progression, which aligns with the idea of conducting a new investigation.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given context best matches sense number 2 of "examination," which refers to a set of questions or exercises evaluating skill or knowledge. In the context of the sentence provided, it seems likely that the speaker is suggesting conducting their own survey or evaluation of some kind, rather than referring to a medical or mental health examination.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the word "suggest," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2 - Imply as a possibility

In the given context, the phrase "I suggest you conduct your own survey" implies that the speaker is offering a suggestion or idea rather than making a direct command or proposal. This sense of "suggest" fits well with the way the word is being used in the sentence, where it means to give someone an idea or a course of action without necessarily committing to it oneself.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "conduct" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Direct the course of; manage or control

The context of the sentence provides evidence for this sense because it implies that the speaker is suggesting someone should conduct their own survey, which fits with the definition of managing or controlling a process. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (44) is higher than any of the other options, indicating that it is the most common meaning of the word in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses of the word "survey," I would choose Sense Number 3: "the act of looking or seeing or observing."

The context of the sentence provides evidence that the speaker is referring to the act of gathering information through observation or sight. For instance, the phrase "I suggest you conduct your own survey" implies that the speaker wants the listener to collect their own data or observations about something. Therefore, the sense of "survey" related to looking or seeing fits best in this situation.

Here is the breakdown of the frequencies for each sense of "survey":

* Sense Number 3: 1
* Sense Number 1: 5
* Sense Number 2: 4

So, the third sense has the lowest frequency among the three options, which supports its selection as the best fit for the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, the most appropriate sense of "choose" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – Select as an alternative over another.

The sentence "Choose 203 business executives, including, perhaps, someone from your own staff, and put them out on the streets to be deprived for one month of their homes, families, and income." implies that the speaker is asking the listener to select or choose a group of people from a larger pool, which aligns with the second definition of "choose". The phrase "put them out on the streets" also supports this interpretation, as it implies a deliberate decision-making process.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "executive" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: a person responsible for the administration of a business.

This sense is the most likely choice because the passage mentions putting people out on the streets without any homes, families, or income, which aligns with the definition of an executive as a person responsible for the administration of a business. The other two senses do not fit well with the context of the passage.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given context best fits sense number 2 of "include," which means "consider as part of something." In this context, the speaker is suggesting that some people, possibly including those from their own staff, should be deprived of their homes, families, and income for one month. Therefore, option 2 is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence you provided best matches sense number 2 of the given list, which defines "put" as "cause to be in a certain state; cause to be in a certain relation". In this case, the speaker is suggesting putting someone out on the street, which implies causing them to be in a difficult or unfavorable situation. This sense of "put" occurs frequently in English language texts, with a frequency of 98, making it the most likely candidate for the intended meaning in this context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'deprive', I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate definition.

The definition of sense number 1, "take away possessions from someone", fits well with the context of putting 203 business executives out on the streets without their homes, families, or income. It aligns with the idea of taking something away from someone, which is evident in the phrase "stripped the Jews of all their assets". Therefore, I believe this sense of 'deprive' best captures the intended meaning in this scenario.

So, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 1"
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "predict" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: make a prediction about; tell in advance

The given context clearly implies that the speaker is making a forecast or prediction about something that will happen in the future, which aligns with the first definition of "predict". The phrase "most of them would find Thunderbird a satisfactory substitute for Chivas Regal" suggests that the speaker is making a comparison between two products, and the prediction they are making is related to how people will react to these products. Additionally, the mention of "phobias", "anxieties", "depressions", and "substance abuse" further supports the idea that the speaker is talking about making predictions about future events rather than indicating something through signs.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "find" in the given sentence is sense number 2: "discover or determine the existence, presence, or fact of".

The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker expects the people they are talking about to discover or become aware of something new and unexpected, which aligns well with the definition of sense 2. For instance, the phrase "their `normal` phobias, anxieties, depressions, and substance abuse would increase dramatically" implies that these things were previously unknown or unacknowledged, but will now become apparent due to some external factor.

Therefore, my answer is: "Sense Number: 2."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses of "increase," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 2: make bigger or more

The sentence "Their phobias, anxieties, depressions, and substance abuse would increase dramatically" implies that something (i.e., those negative emotions or behaviors) will get worse or become more severe, which aligns with the definition of Sense 2. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (61) is higher than the other option (86), suggesting that it is more commonly used in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "account" in this case is:

Additionally, the frequency of this sense in the corpus is relatively high, suggesting that it is the most common meaning of the word in this context.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The sense of "begin" in the given context is (1): take the first step or steps in carrying out an action. This sense is supported by the phrase "Beginning on a reassuring note," which implies that something new or significant is about to happen, and therefore the verb "begin" makes sense as the first step in a new action. Additionally, the frequency count of 375 supports this interpretation, as it is the highest among all the other senses listed.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would choose sense number 2: "be the cause or source of". This sense fits well with the given sentence "He gave me a lot of trouble" because it implies that the speaker believes that the co-author, William Sternberg, was the source of the trouble they experienced.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence " Right up front in the preface, co-author William Sternberg gives us an example of his own integrity" supports the second definition of "example" which means "a representative form or pattern". This sense is supported by the fact that the author is using their own writing style as an example of their integrity. Therefore, option 2 is the most appropriate answer.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "offer" is:

Sense Number: 2 – present for acceptance or rejection

The sentence "He told the reader, ‘mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about, I declined’" clearly implies that "offer" means to present something for acceptance or rejection, which fits with the second definition of the word.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The context of the sentence provides evidence for the first definition of "trip" which means a journey for some purpose (usually including the return). This sense is supported by the fact that the speaker is being offered a free trip from the Bronx to Washington DC, indicating that the trip is a physical journey with a specific destination. Additionally, the phrase "mindful of accepting anything of value from those I was writing about," suggests that the trip has a practical purpose rather than being a random or spontaneous event. Therefore, the best interpretation of the word "trip" in this context is sense number 1.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context given provides enough information to determine that the speaker is using the second definition of "tell" which means "let something be known". In this situation, the speaker is letting it be known that they will be late, so this definition is the most appropriate choice.

The context of the sentence provides evidence that the word "reader" in this case refers to a person who enjoys reading. This sense is the most common usage of the word, with a frequency of 19 out of 100. The example given does not provide any information specific to the other senses of the word, so it is clear that sense number 1 is the best fit for the context.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence you provided, along with the information provided in the possible senses list, strongly suggest that the intended meaning of "accept" in this case is sense #2: "receive willingly something given or offered".

This sense of "accept" aligns with the fact that the speaker is being offered a free trip and is declining it. It also matches the language used in the sentence, where the speaker expresses their reluctance to accept something they were given.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "write_about" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: write about a particular topic

The context of the sentence provides clear evidence that the speaker is being asked to write about something specific, as they are being offered a free trip in exchange for doing so. Additionally, the fact that the speaker is mindful of accepting anything of value from the people they are writing about further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "decline" in this sentence is sense number 2: "refuse to accept".

The sentence "I declined his invitation" implies that the speaker rejected or turned down something, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. The frequency of this sense (4) is also higher than any other option, indicating that it is the most common meaning of the word in this context.

Therefore, I answer:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 2

The word "question" in the given context best fits sense number 2, which defines it as "the subject matter at issue." In the sentence "Any question as to why an author would believe this plaintive , high-minded note of assurance is necessary is answered by reading this book about sticky fingers and sweaty scammers," the term "question" refers to the topic or issue being discussed, rather than an instance of asking for information or clarification. Therefore, sense number 2 is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the given passage suggests that the speaker is referring to the person who created or produced the content being discussed, rather than a professional writer. The phrase "sticky fingers and sweaty scammers" implies that the author of the book being referred to is likely the creator or originator of the work, rather than a paid writer or journalist. Therefore, the second definition of "author" as "someone who originates or causes or initiates something" best fits the context of the passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "believe" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: accept as true; take to be true

In this context, the phrase "this plaintive, high-minded note of assurance" suggests that the speaker is accepting or taking something to be true, which aligns with the first definition of "believe". Additionally, the frequency of this sense (118) is higher than any other option, indicating that it is the most commonly used meaning of the word in this context.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the given passage suggests that the speaker is referring to answering the door. This sense of the word is the most relevant because it aligns with the action described in the sentence. The other senses do not fit as well in the context of the passage. For instance, sense 1 does not make much sense here as there is no indication of reacting verbally in the sentence. Similarly, sense 3 and 4 do not fit as they do not relate directly to the act of opening the door.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word 'read' is:

"Sense Number: 1 - Definition: interpret something that is written or printed"

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for this interpretation, as it refers to interpreting a book or document, which aligns with the first definition of 'read'. Additionally, the frequency count for this sense is higher than any other option, indicating that it is the most commonly used sense of the word in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'book' is:

Additionally, the frequency of this sense (46) is higher than any other option, indicating that it is the most commonly used sense of the word in this context.
Response: Sense Number: 4

The context of the given passage suggests that the author is using the fourth sense of "lead" which means "to travel in front of; go in advance of others". In the passage, it can be observed that the author uses the verb "lead" to describe how Mr. Sternberg and his co-author were leading the reader through the history of Wedtech, starting from its humble beginnings as a small manufacturing company to becoming a full-fledged defense contractor responsible for producing crucial equipment for the army and navy. Therefore, the fourth sense of "lead" is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "path" is:

The context mentions "the path Wedtech traveled," which implies a change in location or movement over time. Additionally, the definition provided for sense number 1 aligns well with the meaning conveyed in the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "company" is:

    Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for sense number 1 matches the meaning of the word in the context of the passage: "an institution created to conduct business." The frequency of this sense is also higher than any other option, with 60 instances in the large corpus of texts. Additionally, the example provided in the passage supports this interpretation, as it refers to the company (Wedtech) being entrusted with the task of producing vital equipment for the Army and Navy, which aligns with the sense of an institution established to conduct business.
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the passage provides evidence that the author intended the verb "produce" to mean "create or manufacture a man-made product." The phrase "from its inception as a small manufacturing company" supports this interpretation, as it implies that Wedtech was initially a small firm focused on creating products through manufacturing processes. Additionally, the mention of "vital equipment for the Army and Navy" further reinforces this sense, as these are complex systems that were likely designed and built by Wedtech rather than simply being obtained from elsewhere.

Therefore, given the information provided in the context, the most appropriate sense of "produce" is sense number 2: "create or manufacture a man-made product".
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would choose Sense Number 1 as the most appropriate definition for the word "book". Here's why:

Sense Number: 1
Definition: a written work or composition that has been published (printed on pages bound together)

In the given context, the sentence mentions "the book", which could refer to any written document, but considering the phrase "creation of Wedtech" it seems like we are talking about a business-related topic, and therefore the most likely meaning of "book" in this case is a published written work related to business or entrepreneurship. Additionally, the fact that there are multiple people mentioned in the sentence ("John Mariotta" and "Fred Neuberger") further supports this interpretation, as it suggests that we are dealing with a written account or documentation of some sort.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the available information, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "revolve_around" is:

Sense Number: 1 – Center Upon

This definition matches the context provided, as it implies that something is focused on or centered around someone or something else. In this case, the text states that the book revolves around John Mariotta and Fred Neuberger, which aligns with the first sense of the word. Additionally, the frequency count of 2 suggests that this sense is more commonly used than the other option.
Response: Sense Number: 2 - Undergo a change or development
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "partner" in this case is sense number 2: "an associate in an activity or endeavor or sphere of common interest."

Here's why: In the context you provided, John Mariotta and Fred Neuberger are described as being involved in some kind of business venture together, specifically the creation of Wedtech. This fits with the definition of "partner" as someone who works jointly with another person in a particular field or activity. Additionally, the fact that there is no example available for sense number 3 ("a person who is a member of a partnership") supports the conclusion that the authors are referring to a broader sense of the term here.

So, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best definition of "start" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Set in motion, cause to start.

The context mentions "Mr. Neuberger discovering the federal government's Section 8 A minority business program," which implies that something was previously unknown or unused but then became active or operational due to Mr. Neuberger's discovery. This aligns with the definition of "start" as setting something in motion or causing it to begin.
Response: Sense Number: 1
The context of the given text supports the definition of "get" as "come into the possession of something concrete or abstract". This sense is the most frequent one in the corpus, with a frequency of 235. The example sentence provided also fits best with this sense: "She got a lot of paintings from her uncle."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would choose sense number 2: "move along on or as if on wheels or a wheeled vehicle". This sense of "roll" best fits the context because it aligns with the meaning of moving something along, such as a vehicle, which is what is happening in the sentence.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given context best fits sense number 2 of "discover", which means "get to know or become aware of, usually accidentally". In this context, the speaker learns about the federal government's Section 8 A minority business program in 1975, after it had already been established in 1965. Therefore, the most appropriate sense of "discover" in this case is sense number 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "programme" in this case is sense number 1:

Sense Number: 1

The definition provided for this sense matches the context of the sentence perfectly. The author mentions "the federal government's Section 8 A minority business program," which aligns with the definition of "an announcement of the events that will occur as part of a theatrical or sporting event." Therefore, it seems that the author intended to use the term "programme" in its sense as a schedule or program of events.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'creation' is:

Sense Number: 2 – Definition: an artifact that has been brought into existence by someone

The frequency of this sense in the given corpus is 4, which suggests that it is a relatively common usage of the word. The example provided also supports this sense: "No example available."
Response: Sense Number: 1

The given context best matches sense number one of the possible senses of "mandate," which means "assign under a mandate." In this sense, the word refers to assigning something, such as a task or responsibility, to someone or something else under a specific instruction or directive.

In the given context, "This is a Johnson-era, Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses" implies that the government has assigned or delegated the task of awarding contracts to minority businesses without going through a competitive bidding process. Therefore, sense number one is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "contract" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided for sense number 1 fits well with the context of the sentence you provided. The phrase "Johnson-era, Great Society creation" suggests that the speaker is referring to a federal government program or policy from the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, and the clause "mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses" further supports this interpretation. Given this context, it makes sense that the word "contract" refers to a binding agreement between two or more parties that is enforceable by law, as mentioned in sense number 1.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "award" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – give as judged due or on the basis of merit.

The phrase "mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses" suggests that the word "award" is being used in the sense of giving something as a result of a judgment or evaluation, rather than simply giving something without any particular criteria. Therefore, sense number 2 is the most suitable choice for this context.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The second definition of "realize" in the list matches the context provided:

Definition: perceive (an idea or situation) mentally

In the given sentence, "Mr. Neuberger realized that...", the verb "realize" means to understand or perceive something mentally, which fits with the second definition.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The best interpretation of the word "qualify" in the given context is sense #2, which means "pronounce fit or able." This definition matches the meaning of the sentence, where Mr. Neuberger is considering whether Mr. Mariotta, who is of Italian ancestry but born in Puerto Rico, can be considered a minority person. The sentence implies that Mr. Mariotta meets the criteria of being fit or able to fulfill the role of a minority person, hence the use of the verb "qualify."
Response: Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 2

Based on the context provided, the best fit for the ambiguous word "have" is sense number 2, which defines it as "have as a feature." The phrase "the two partners merely had to falsify the true ownership of the corporation" implies that they needed to manipulate or alter the ownership of the company, which aligns better with the meaning of having something as a feature rather than any other sense. Additionally, there are no obvious matches between the other senses and the context provided.
Response: Sense Number: 4

Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of "falsify" that fits best is sense number 4, which means "falsify knowingly". In this context, the partners are deliberately misrepresenting the true ownership of the corporation, indicating a conscious effort to deceive. Therefore, option 4 best captures the intended meaning of the author.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence you provided suggests that by "falsify the true ownership of the corporation," the speaker means to misrepresent who actually owns the company. Therefore, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "ownership" in this case is sense number 2: the act of having and controlling property. This definition matches the idea of manipulating or altering the ownership status of something, which aligns with the intended meaning of the sentence.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given context supports the second definition of "become" as "undergo a change or development." In the sentence, "on paper only," implies that something is not yet actualized but is planned or intended, which aligns with the idea of something undergoing a change or development. Additionally, the mention of "two-thirds Mariotta" and "one-third Neuberger" suggests a shift or alteration in some aspect of these individuals or things, further supporting sense 2.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context given provides evidence that the word "locate" in this sentence refers to determining or indicating the place, site, or limits of something, as if by an instrument or by a survey. This sense is consistent with the definition provided for sense number 2, which states that it means to determine or indicate the place, site, or limits of something.

In the given sentence, the phrase "in the South Bronx" implies a specific geographic location, and the mention of Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign further supports the idea that the speaker is referring to locating a particular place or area. Therefore, sense number 2 is the most appropriate choice for the meaning of "locate" in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I believe the most appropriate sense of the word "area" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 – a subject of study

The context mentions "Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign," which implies that the word "area" is being used as a term related to a field of study or a particular topic of interest. This sense of the word is also supported by the fact that the sentence does not provide any information about the location or physical characteristics of the place referred to, which aligns with the definition of "subject of study."
Response: 
Sense Number: 8
The given sentence "Besides being a `minority-owned company` Wedtech was located in the South Bronx, a blighted area, made famous by Jimmy Carter in his 1976 presidential campaign." best fits sense number 8, "cause to do; cause to act in a specified manner". This sense is appropriate because the sentence highlights the location of Wedtech in the South Bronx and its association with Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign, which implies that someone caused Wedtech to be located there or to gain attention due to its minority ownership.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "company" is sense number 1:

Sense Number: 1 - An institution created to conduct business
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the verb "rebuild" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: build again

This sense of the word fits well with the context because the author mentions the company plugging themselves into Carter campaign rhetoric about rebuilding the South Bronx, which implies that they are talking about building something again, rather than simply mentioning the location. Additionally, the example given in the definition matches the idea of building something again, as a house being built after being hit by a bomb.
Response: Sense Number: 2
"Keep" in this context most likely means "continue a certain state, condition, or activity". This usage is supported by the phrase "keep using the minority — South Bronx angle", which implies that the company has been consistently promoting their focus on the South Bronx community throughout the Reagan years.
Response: Sense Number: 1

Based on the context you provided, the most likely sense of the word "use" in this passage is definition 1: "put into service; make work or employ for a particular purpose or for its inherent or natural purpose". This sense is supported by the fact that the phrase "plugged itself right into" implies a direct application or integration of something into another thing, which aligns with the meaning of "use" as outlined in definition 1. Additionally, the mention of "Carter campaign rhetoric" and "Reagan '80s" suggests a political or ideological focus, which fits well with the idea of using something for a specific purpose or goal.
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of "start" is:

Sense Number: 2 – Set in motion, cause to start.

This sense aligns well with the context provided, where the author mentions the company's history of bribing public officials, including E. Robert Wallach, who was close to former Attorney General Ed Meese. Starting something implies a deliberate act of setting in motion a course of action, which fits with the illegal activities described in the passage.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for the second definition of "serve" which means "do duty or hold offices; serve in a specific function". In this sentence, the phrase "the company began a career of bribing federal, state and local public officials..." implies that the subject, "company", has been engaging in illegal activities such as bribery over a period of time. Therefore, it is likely that "serve" here refers to the act of holding positions of authority within these organizations and using them for nefarious purposes.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context given, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "sentence" is:

    Sense Number: 2 - (criminal law) a final judgment of guilty in a criminal case and the punishment that is imposed.

This sense of the word "sentence" fits best in the context because it refers to a legal penalty or punishment, which aligns with the mention of "jail sentence" in the passage. The other two senses do not seem relevant to the context provided.
Response: Sense Number: 3

The context of the sentence you provided suggests that the speaker is referring to the state of being with someone, specifically a person who is accompanying another individual. Therefore, sense number 3, which defines "company" as the state of being with someone, is the most appropriate choice. This definition aligns with the usage of the term in the given sentence, where the speaker mentions missing the company of someone.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The given context clearly supports the first definition of "begin" which means "take the first step or steps in carrying out an action". The sentence mentions "the company began a career of bribing...", indicating that the speaker is referring to the act of initiating or starting something illegal or unethical. Therefore, option 1 best fits the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose Sense Number 2: "the general progression of your working or professional life".

The sentence "the company began a career of bribing federal, state and local public officials" suggests that the speaker is referring to the overall path or trajectory of the company's actions over time, rather than a specific job or occupation. This aligns better with Sense 2, which defines "career" as the general progression of one's working or professional life.

Additionally, the absence of any examples for Sense 1 supports this choice, as it seems unlikely that the speaker would refer to a specific occupation when discussing a pattern of behavior spanning multiple individuals and institutions.
Response: Sure! I have reviewed the given information, and after analyzing it, my answer as a linguistics expert would be:

"Sense Number: 1". 
The first definition fits best into the context provided because it refers to making illegal payment to someone in exchange for favor or influence which aligns with what the text says about the company starting to bribe government officials, including a close friend of the attorney general.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'official' is:

Sense Number: 2 - someone who administers the rules of a game or sport.

The example provided in the context supports this choice as it refers to a golf player asking for an official who could provide them with a ruling. This sense of 'officiail' is also consistent with its definition of someone who administers the rules of a game or sport.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence that the speaker means "consider as part of something" when using the word "include". The phrase "right up to and including E. Robert Wallach" implies that the speaker is listing people who were involved in the illegal activity, and it makes sense that they would include Wallach because he was close friends with former Attorney General Ed Meese. Additionally, the definition of sense 2 ("I include you in the list of culprits") matches well with the context of the sentence. Therefore, the most appropriate sense of "include" in this case is sense 2.
Response: Sense Number: 2
Response: 
Sense Number: 1
Response: Sense Number: 2: What something is used for. 

The context of the sentence you provided highlights the second definition of "use" as it refers to the purpose or function of something. The phrase "including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofziger" also supports this interpretation since Nofziger was known for his political consulting services. Therefore, the best answer is sense number 2, which defines "use" as meaning "what something is used for".
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence you provided supports the second definition of "retain" which means "allow to remain in a place or position or maintain a property or feature". In this case, the sentence implies that the subject "It" made use of modern techniques of influence peddling by retaining politically connected law firms, investment bankers, and political consultants, including Reagan confidant Lyn Nofziger. Therefore, the best match for the given context is sense number 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses of the ambiguous word "include", I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 2 - Consider as part of something."

In the given sentence, the phrase "including...law firms..." implies that the writer is mentioning specific entities as part of a larger group, which aligns with the definition of Sense 2. The high frequency of this sense (32) also supports its selection.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given context best fits the second definition of "seek" which means "try to locate or discover, or try to establish the existence of." In this sense, the verb "seek" implies that something is being looked for or searched for, such as information, evidence, or help.

In the context of the sentence provided, "it sought and received assistance from organized crime," the word "seek" implies that the entity was trying to find or obtain help from organized crime, rather than simply locating them. Therefore, sense number 2 is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The context of the sentence you provided best fits sense number 1 of "receive," which means "get something; come into possession of." This sense is supported by the fact that the sentence mentions "assistance" being given or received, implying that something tangible is being acquired. According to the frequency data provided, this sense of "receive" occurs 122 times in the corpus, indicating its commonality in everyday language usage.
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence you provided best fits with the second definition of "become," which means "undergo a change or development." In this case, the word "became" implies that something happened to the person or thing mentioned earlier, indicating a transformation or change. The other definitions do not fit as well in the given sentence, as they refer to different meanings such as entering a certain state or coming into existence. Therefore, I would choose sense number 2 as the most appropriate answer.
Response: Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I would say that the best sense of the ambiguous word 'management' in your sentence is:

"Sense Number: 1"

The definition provided for sense number 1 fits well with the context of the sentence you provided. The phrase "used the merit system" implies that there are people in positions of authority or leadership within Wedtech who are responsible for overseeing and directing various aspects of the organization. Therefore, the sense of "management" that refers to the act of managing something (i.e., leading, supervising, or directing an organization) makes the most sense in this context.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context you provided, 'Wedtech management used the merit system', best fits with the second definition of "use" which means "take or consume (regularly or habitually)." This sense is supported by the fact that the word "used" is present in the sentence, indicating that something has been consumed or taken. Additionally, the phrase "merit system" implies a regular or habitual practice of evaluating performance, which aligns with the meaning of "consume."
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence 'Wedtech management used the merit system.' suggests that the word 'system' refers to a group of independent but interrelated elements that make up a unified whole. This definition matches the frequency information provided, as it is the highest-frequency sense of the word in the given corpus. The example sentence also supports this interpretation, as it describes a complex of methods or rules governing behavior. Therefore, I conclude that the most appropriate sense of the word 'system' in this context is sense number 2.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence "If you were especially helpful in a corrupt scheme you received not just cash in a bag, but equity" suggests that the best fit for the ambiguous word "receive" is sense number 2, which defines it as "receive a specified treatment (abstract)." This sense is supported by the fact that the phrase "corrupt scheme" implies a specific type of illegal activity, and therefore "receive" should be interpreted in a technical or abstract sense rather than any of the other possibilities. Additionally, the mention of "equity" further supports this interpretation, as it refers to a specific legal concept related to corporate ownership.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The given context and the provided list of possible senses suggest that the most likely meaning of "equity" in the sentence is:

Definition: the difference between the market value of a property and the claims held against it

This definition matches the context of the sentence, where the speaker mentions receiving "equity" as a reward for being especially helpful in a corrupt scheme. The phrase "cash in a bag" also supports this interpretation, as it implies a financial benefit or reward. Therefore, I conclude that the sense of "equity" that best fits the context is #1, which refers to the difference between the market value of a property and the claims held against it.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for the second definition of "find" which means "discover or determine the existence, presence, or fact of". In the given sentence, the speaker mentions that Mr. Mariotta, the firm's "semiliterate `minority` person", found themselves in a fate of being left out in the cold, suggesting that their status as a semiliterate individual in the company led to them being marginalized or excluded. This sense of "find" aligns well with the meaning of the sentence and highlights the theme of social inequality and discrimination.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'fate', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 2 - the ultimate agency regards as predicting the course of events (often personified as a woman)"

This sense fits well with the context of the sentence provided, where 'fate' is referred to as something that will inevitably happen in the future. It also aligns with the definition provided for this sense, which describes it as the ultimate agency regarded as predetermining the course of events. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (4) is higher than the other two options, suggesting that it is the most common usage of the word in the given context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the provided senses of the ambiguous word "befall", the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 1"

The definition provided for sense number 1 matches the meaning of the word in the context of the sentence given: "He promised that no harm would befall her". This sense of "befall" means to happen to someone or something, often implying a negative outcome. Therefore, it is the most likely sense of the word in this particular context.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for the second sense of "person" as the intended meaning. In this sense, "person" refers to a human body, usually including the clothing. The phrase "a fate that eventually befell Mr. Mariotta," which follows the mention of "the firm's semiliterate `minority` person," further supports this interpretation, as it implies that Mr. Mariotta's demise resulted from his actions as a criminal. Additionally, the fact that only one sense of "person" has a non-zero frequency in the given corpus lends credence to this interpretation, as it suggests that the other two senses are less common or specialized uses of the term.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "fall short" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: Fail to meet ( expectations or standards )

The context of the passage suggests that the author is criticizing the article "Feeding Frenzy" for failing to live up to its potential as a gripping read, rather than simply not being exciting enough. Therefore, the first definition of "fall short," which refers to failing to meet expectations or standards, is the best fit for the situation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "show," I would choose sense number 2: "establish the validity of something, as by an example, explanation or experiment."

The sentence "Auditors found crookery the first day on the job" implies that something suspicious or illegal was discovered, which aligns with the definition of sense number 2. Additionally, the context does not suggest any other senses of the word "show" are relevant in this case. Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given sentence highlights the usage of the word "ingenuity" as it relates to something that shows originality and cleverness, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. According to the provided data, this sense of "ingenuity" occurs only once in the corpus of text, but the sentence itself provides evidence of its usage in this manner.

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for the second definition of "find" which means "discover or determine the existence, presence, or fact of". In this case, the word "find" implies that there was some kind of search or investigation that led to the discovery of something unexpected or surprising, such as "crookery", which is an unusual or uncommon term. Therefore, option 2 best fits the context given.
Response: Sure! I have carefully reviewed the information you provided about the ambiguous term "bribe" and its various meanings. Based on the given context and examples, my answer as a linguistics expert would be:

"Sense Number: 1."

The first definition of "bribe," which refers to making illicit payments to someone in exchange for favorable treatment or influence, seems to best fit the context provided. The phrase "Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up" implies that the individuals involved in the situation were offering money or other forms of compensation to silence their accusers. Given the negative connotations associated with this meaning of the word, it aligns well with the context provided.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 2: "place in a place where something cannot be removed or someone cannot escape".

The sentence "Wedtech 's scammers simply bribed them to shut up" implies that the speaker is referring to someone being silenced or confined against their will, which aligns well with the definition of sense number 2. The fact that it occurs only once in the given corpus also supports this interpretation.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sense Number: 2

In the given context, the best fit for the ambiguous word "want" is sense number 2, which defines it as having a need for something. The phrase "the scammers themselves were garden-variety low lifes, conspicuous consumers who wanted big houses, Mercedes cars, beautiful women, expensive clothes" implies that these individuals had a strong desire or need for material possessions and luxury items. Therefore, the second definition of "want" fits best in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, I would choose Sense Number 1 as the most appropriate sense of the word "clothes" in this instance. Here's why:

Sense Number: 1

Definition: Clothing in general
Frequency: 44
Example: She was refined in her choice of apparel

In this sentence, the term "clothes" refers to various types of clothing that someone wears. It does not specify any particular type of garment or style, but rather encompasses all kinds of clothing in general. Given the diverse range of consumer goods mentioned earlier in the passage, it makes sense that the speaker would refer to the scammers' fashion choices using a broad term like "clothes."
Response: Sense Number: 1

The given context best fits the first definition of "wrestle" as "to combat or struggle against something." In this case, the speaker is saying that none of the people among whom they find themselves are grappling with moral issues such as good vs. evil, intelligence, or sanity. Therefore, the most suitable meaning of "wrestle" in this scenario is sense number 1, which refers to the act of combating or overcoming an opposing tendency or force.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best definition of "change" in this case is sense number 2: "undergo a change; become different in essence; losing one's or its original nature."

This sense of "change" fits well with the information provided in the context. The sentence mentions Dr. Irving Louis Lobsenz changing his name to Rusty Kent London, which aligns with the meaning of this sense of the word. Additionally, the phrase "became a master gambler and author of a book on blackjack" suggests that Dr. Lobsenz underwent a significant change in his identity and interests, which also supports this interpretation.

Therefore, I conclude that the best definition of "change" in this passage is sense number 2.
Response: Sense Number: 1

In this context, the best fit for the ambigious word 'name' is sense number 1, as it refers to a person's given name or identity. The sentence "his name really is George Washington" supports this interpretation, as it identifies the speaker's referent using their given name. The other senses do not fit as well in this context, as sense number 2 does not apply because there is no mention of reputation, sense number 3 does not make sense in relation to the previous sentence, sense number 4 is unlikely given that there is no reference to any famous people, and sense number 5 is irrelevant due to the lack of any legal references. Finally, sense number 6 cannot be selected since there is no evidence of any offensive or derogatory term being used.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "become", I would choose sense number 2: "undergo a change or development".

Here's why: In the context of the sentence, we see that someone named Irving Louis Lobsenz changed their name to Rusty Kent London, which implies that they underwent a change or development in themselves. This sense of "become" aligns well with the meaning of the sentence.

Therefore, my answer is: Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context you provided best matches sense number 2 of the possible senses for 'author', which defines it as "someone who originates or causes or initiates something". In this context, the phrase "became a master gambler and author" implies that Irving Louis Lobsenz changed his name and pursued a new career as a writer and gambler, originating or causing these changes himself. Therefore, the most appropriate sense of 'author' in this context is sense number 2.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides evidence that the speaker means sense 2 of "enter," which is "become a participant; be involved in." The sentence specifically states that he enters the story "just in time to get arrested," indicating that he becomes a participant in the story at some point after it has already begun. This sense is supported by its high frequency usage in the corpus, with 24 examples found.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The given sentence "He enters the story toward the end , just in time to get arrested" best fits sense number one of "come into the possession of something concrete or abstract".

Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word 'scandal' in this case is:

The context of the passage mentions "Section 8," which refers to a specific federal program, suggesting that the scandal being referred to is likely related to a particular incident or event involving that program. Additionally, the phrase "doling out" implies a deliberate action taken by someone, rather than just gossip or rumors about someone else's private life.

In this sentence, "they might want to end rigid affirmative action programs," it makes sense that the speaker would use the sense of "want" meaning "have need of."

The context of the sentence suggests that the speaker is discussing the potential ending of something, such as a program or a relationship. Sense number 2 fits best because it implies bringing something to a stop or conclusion, which aligns with the meaning implied by the context.

Here's why I ruled out the other senses:

* Sense number 1 does not fit well because it refers to having an end in a general sense, without any specific modifier or context. While the termination of bronchioles could involve an end, it doesn't relate directly to the topic of ending something discussed in the context.
* Sense number 3 does not fit because it simply means being the last part of something, without any implication of bringing something to an end. In the context, there is no indication that the thing in question will cease to exist after its end.
* Sense number 4 does not fit because it implies putting an end to something, but the context does not suggest that anything has already been brought to an end. Instead, it seems to indicate a possibility or concern about something coming to an end in the future.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "program" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - a system of projects or services intended to meet a public need.

Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the available information, I would say that the best definition of "scoff" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: laugh at with contempt and derision

This sense of "scoff" aligns well with the given context where the speakers at the table are laughing at the suggestion of interrupting their Saturday morning activities to go golfing or even hot air ballooning. It also matches the frequency information provided, as the sense has been found to occur 4 times in a large corpus of texts.

Here's why I ruled out the other two possibilities: While the second sense ("treat with contemptuous disregard") could technically fit the context, it doesn't quite capture the same connotation of mockery and disdain as the first sense does. Additionally, there isn't enough evidence in the text to support the third sense ("flout the rules"), which implies a deliberate act of breaking or ignoring rules rather than just treating something with indifference.
Response: Sense Number: 2

In the given context, the best fit for the ambiguity of the word "interrupt" is sense number 2, which defines it as "destroy the peace or tranquility of". This definition matches well with the situation described in the passage where the speaker objects to being interrupted while they are reading. The frequency of this sense is moderate (5), indicating that it is not an uncommon usage of the word but rather one that has multiple meanings and can be used depending on the context.
Response: Sense Number: 1

In this context, the word "morning" can be interpreted as referring to the time period between dawn and noon. This sense is supported by the fact that the sentence mentions "a perfectly good Saturday morning," which implies that it is a specific point in time rather than a general greeting or farewell. Additionally, the mention of "errands" being run during this time further reinforces this interpretation. Therefore, Sense Number 1 is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "response" in this case is:

Sense Number: 3

The context mentions "heartwarmingly covetous responses," which aligns with the definition of "a statement (either spoken or written) that is made to reply to a question or request or criticism or accusation." This sense of "response" fits best in the given context as it implies a verbal reaction or reply to something.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the context and the given possible senses, I would choose Sense Number: 2 - "become inflated".

The sentence "You went ballooning?" implies that something has become inflated or expanded, which aligns better with the second definition of "balloon" as "to become inflated". Additionally, the example provided ("The sails ballooned") further supports this interpretation.

Therefore, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context you provided best fits sense number 2 of "seem," which means "to appear to be true, probable, or apparent." In this sentence, "it seems" implies that there is an appearance or indication that Americans have taken to ballooning in a significant manner, rather than simply giving the impression of doing so. This sense of "seem" is the most suitable option given the context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "follow" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - be later in time

The context suggests that Americans have taken to ballooning in a heady way, which implies that there has been a recent increase in interest in this activity. Additionally, the phrase "Tuesday always follows Monday" supports this interpretation, as it highlights the temporal relationship between these two days. Therefore, the sense of "follow" that fits best in this context is the one related to being later in time.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the best definition for "lead" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - a soft heavy toxic malleable metallic element; bluish white when freshly cut but tarnishes readily to dull grey.

The context of the sentence "Americans it seems have followed Malcolm Forbes 's hot-air lead and taken to ballooning in a heady way" suggests that the author is using the term "lead" to refer to a material or object, rather than a competition or position of leadership. Additionally, the reference to "taking to ballooning" implies that the "lead" being referred to is something tangible and related to technology or innovation, which aligns with the definition of lead as a metallic element.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the available information, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'take_to' in this case is:

"Sense Number: 2 - develop a habit; apply oneself to a practice or occupation."

This sense makes the most sense in the given context because the phrase "taken to ballooning in a heady way" implies a sudden or recent development of interest in ballooning, which aligns better with the definition of "develop a habit". Additionally, there isn't enough information to support the idea of having a personal preference or fondness for something, as suggested by Sense Number 1.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The sense of "number" that best fits in the given context is sense number 1, which defines it as the property possessed by a sum or total or indefinite quantity of units or individuals. This makes perfect sense when you consider how the text talks about the increase in the number of balloonists passing the FAA test over the past 25 years. It implies that there is a growing population of balloonists, indicating a larger number of individuals who have undergone training and obtained certification.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would choose Sense Number 2: "move past" for the ambiguous word 'pass'. This sense is supported by the fact that the text mentions "black limousine passed by" which implies movement in front of someone or something.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The sense of "test" that best fits in the given context is definition #2, which refers to any standardized procedure for measuring sensitivity or memory or intelligence or aptitude or personality etc. In the given sentence, "the number of balloonists...have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand," implies that there is a systematic evaluation or measurement being made of the number of people involved in the activity of ballooning. Therefore, sense #2 is the most suitable choice.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the six possible senses of the word "swell," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 1"

The definition provided for Sense Number 1 ("increase in size, magnitude, number, or intensity") best fits the context of the passage. The author mentions that the number of balloonists has increased significantly over the past 25 years, which aligns with the first sense of "swell." Additionally, the example provided ("the music swelled to a crescendo") also supports this sense.
Response: Sense Number: 4

The given context suggests that the speaker is referring to an estimate in the sense of a prediction or rough calculation of the cost of something, such as a job or a project. Therefore, sense number 4 is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sense Number: 2
The word 'run' in the context of the passage refers to the verb meaning 'to move fast by using one's feet, with one foot off the ground at any given time'. This sense is the most relevant to the sentence 'Don't run--you'll be out of breath', which implies that the listener should not attempt to move quickly because they will get tired.
Response: Sense Number: 2
The given sentence suggests that 'hold' means 'have or keep in one's hands or grip'.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'include' is:

    Sense Number: 2 - Consider as part of something.

This sense fits best because the passage mentions "the list includes the names of many famous writers" which implies that the writer is considering those individuals as part of a larger collection of famous writers.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word "attract," I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1 - Direct towards itself or oneself by means of some psychological power or physical attributes.

The sentence "Her good looks attract the stares of many men" supports this sense as it implies that the subject's physical appearance is drawing attention towards herself. This sense is also supported by its higher frequency (23) compared to the other two senses.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "balloon" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition you provided fits well with the context of the passage, where it is mentioned that there are 800,000 enthusiasts and over 500 balloons at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. It seems likely that the author intended to refer to the first definition of a large, non-rigid bag filled with gas or heated air, as this is consistent with the scale of the event described in the passage.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "shape" in the given sentence is sense number 2:

Sense Number: 2 - Make something, usually for a specific function.

In the given sentence, the word "shape" could be interpreted as meaning "make something," specifically balloons, which are being described as being made into various shapes, such as those resembling Carmen Miranda, Garfield, or a 12-story-high condom. This interpretation aligns with the definition of sense number 2, which refers to creating or forming something for a particular purpose or function.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. After analyzing the given context and the list of possible senses for the ambiguous word "resemble," I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense is "appear like; be similar or bear a likeness to." This sense is supported by the example sentence provided in the question, where the author states that some of the balloons at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta "resemble" Carmen Miranda. The high frequency of this sense in the corpus data (24) also supports its selection as the best interpretation of the word in this context.
Response: Sense Number: 2

In this context, the best fit for the ambiguous word "balloon" is sense number 2, which defines it as a small, thin, inflatable rubber bag with a narrow neck. This definition matches the meaning of the sentence provided, as the speaker is referring to an object that is being denied entry, which fits better with the idea of a small, confined space like a balloon. Additionally, the frequency count for this sense is higher than the other option, suggesting that it is more common usage of the word.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence you provided best matches sense number 2 of the word "deny", which means "refuse to accept or believe". This sense is supported by the fact that the sentence refers to something being denied entry status, which aligns with the meaning of refusing to accept or believe that it should be allowed entry. Additionally, the other options do not fit quite as well in the context of the sentence, such as sense number 1, which would imply contradiction rather than refusal to accept, and sense number 3, which does not make much sense in the context of a petition or request being denied.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses of the ambiguous word 'status', I would say that the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 1"

In this context, the word 'status' can be interpreted as the relative position or standing of something or someone in a society, which aligns with the first definition provided. The frequency of this sense in the corpus also supports this interpretation, as it occurs 20 times more often than the second sense. Additionally, the example provided ("he had the status of a minor") further reinforces this interpretation.
Response: Sure, I'd be happy to help you determine the meaning of the word 'hold' in the given context. After analyzing the list of possible senses, I believe the most appropriate sense is sense number 2: "have or hold in one's hands or grip."

The phrase "hold all the attraction for most people of sunrise root- canal work" suggests that something (root canal work) is being held or attractive to people, which aligns with the definition of sense 2. Additionally, the context does not suggest any other meanings of the word 'hold' that would fit better, such as sense number 1 (keep in a certain state), which implies a more permanent or long-term relationship, or sense number 3 (organize or be responsible for), which refers to a broader scope of responsibility rather than just having something in one's hand.
Response: Sense Number: 3

The context of the given sentence suggests that the speaker finds the act of ballooning at dawn to be fascinating or interesting, rather than the idea of a specific entertainer drawing a crowd. Therefore, the third definition of "attraction" as "the quality of arousing interest; being attractive or something that attracts" best fits the situation.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The context of the sentence provides evidence for the first definition of "feel" as "undergo an emotional sensation or be in a particular state of mind." In this case, the speaker is experiencing a nagging cultural imperative that leads them to take action, signifying that they are feeling a strong emotional response. Therefore, the most appropriate sense of "feel" in this sentence is sense number 1 with a frequency rating of 181.
Response: Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the given sentence strongly suggests that the speaker is using the word "thing" to refer to an action or activity, specifically the act of ballooning itself. The phrase "it requires zip in the way of athletic prowess," implies that there is some physical effort involved in the process, which aligns with the definition of sense 2, which defines "thing" as an action. Additionally, the example sentence provided ("how could you do such a thing?) further supports this interpretation, as it implies that the speaker is questioning the listener's ability to perform the action of ballooning. Therefore, the most appropriate sense of the word "thing" in this context is sense 2.
Response: Sure, I can help you determine the most appropriate sense of the word 'tell' in the given context. After analyzing the possible senses provided, I believe the most appropriate sense is:

"Sense Number: 2 - Let something be known."

In the context of the sentence, the speaker is advising someone to communicate information to another person, which aligns best with the definition of sense 2. The frequency of this sense (189) also supports this choice, as it is the highest among all the other senses provided. Additionally, the example sentence provided ("Tell them that you will be late") further reinforces this interpretation.
Response: Sense Number: 2

Based on the given context, the best fit for the ambiguous word "require" is sense number 2, which defines the verb as considering something obligatory or requesting and expecting it. In the given sentence, the author states that "it takes nerve to do what she did," indicating that they believe it takes courage or determination to perform the action described. Therefore, the most appropriate sense of "require" in this case is sense number 2, where the verb means to consider something necessary or essential.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "zip" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: a quantity of no importance; Frequency: 0; Example: it looked like nothing I had ever seen before.

In this context, "zip" likely refers to a small amount or degree of something, as the author mentions that it appeared to be nothing significant.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The given context "So long as you don't look down" best fits sense number 1 of the provided list, which defines "look" as "perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards". This sense is supported by the fact that the phrase "don't look down" implies that the speaker wants the listener to focus their attention on something above them, rather than looking downwards. Therefore, the most likely meaning of "look" in this context is to perceive or direct one's gaze towards something upwards.
Response: Sure, I am happy to help you with that! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the verb "tell" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Let something be known

The context of the sentence "They will also tell you that even if you hate heights, you can still balloon." implies that someone is sharing information or passing along a message, which aligns with the definition of "let something be known". The high frequency of this sense (189) supports this interpretation, as it is one of the most common uses of the verb "tell".
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and information, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "hate" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 – Definition: dislike intensely; feel antipathy or aversion towards

This sense of "hate" fits best in the context because it implies a strong negative feeling towards something, which aligns with the meaning of the phrase "even if you hate heights."
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given context suggests that the speaker is referring to the second definition of "balloon," which means "become inflated." In the sentence provided, "the sails ballooned," it implies that they became inflated or puffed up. Therefore, sense number 2 is the most appropriate choice.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would choose Sense Number 2: "report or maintain".

The context of the sentence "I still say don't look down" implies that someone is advising against doing something, which aligns well with the definition of "report or maintain" as a verb meaning to provide information about something or to keep track of it. Additionally, the frequency of this sense of "say" at 254 instances in the corpus supports its selection. Here is an example sentence using this sense: "She alleged that she had been bullied at work."
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context given, the most appropriate sense of the word "look" in the sentence "I still say don't look down." is:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense is "perceive with attention; direct one's gaze towards". This sense fits well in the context because it implies that the speaker is advising someone not to look downwards, which aligns with the meaning of the sentence as a whole.

The other senses do not fit as well in the context:

* Sense Number 2: This sense means "give a certain impression or have a certain outward aspect", which does not seem relevant to the context.
* Sense Number 3: This sense means "have a certain outward or facial expression", but the sentence does not provide enough information to determine if this sense applies.
* Sense Number 4: This sense means "search or seek", which is also not applicable to the context.
* Sense Number 5: This sense means "be oriented in a certain direction, often with respect to another reference point; be opposite to", which does not make sense in the context.
* Sense Number 6: This sense means "take charge of or deal with", but there is no indication in the context who is taking charge or dealing with what.
* Sense Number 7: This sense means "convey by one's expression", but there is no explicit mention of expressing anything in the context.
* Sense Number 8: This sense means "look forward to the probable occurrence of", but there is no indication in the context of what is being looked forward to.
* Sense Number 9: This sense means "accord in appearance with", but there is no suggestion in the context of anyone looking like something else.
* Sense Number 10: This sense means "have faith or confidence in", but there is no indication in the context of anyone having faith or confidence in what.
Response: Sense Number: 1

The context of the sentence "At least not when you are ascending" suggests that the speaker does not want to do something when they are going upward, which aligns with the first definition of "ascend" as "travel up." Therefore, the most appropriate sense of "ascend" in this case is sense number 1.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The best fit for the given context is sense number 2, which defines "tell" as "let something be known". In this context, the speaker is advising someone not to engage in an activity that may result in getting wet, so it makes sense that the speaker would want to let the person know about the potential danger. The frequency of this sense is relatively high, indicating that it is a common usage of the word.

Here is an example sentence using this sense: "Tell your friends that we will meet at the park tomorrow."
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the best match for the ambiguous word "go" in the sentence "What they wo n't tell you is not to go aloft in anything you don't want to get wet." is sense number 1:

Sense Number: 1 Definition: change location; move, travel, or proceed, also metaphorically Frequency: 343 Example: How fast does your new car go?

In this context, the speaker is warning against venturing into dangerous or unpleasant situations, implying that one should avoid getting wet. The use of the verb "go" in this sense implies movement or progression towards a destination, but in this case, the destination is undesirable.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence "What they won't tell you is not to go aloft in anything you don't want to get wet" suggests that the speaker is using the sense of "want" as "have need of". In this case, the speaker is warning someone against going up high in something because it will likely get wet.

This sense of "want" occurs 15 times in the given corpus of text, which supports its usage in this context. Here is an example sentence from the corpus that uses this sense of "want": "I want my car to start every time I turn the key."
Response: Sense Number: 1
The given sentence "What they won't tell you is not to go aloft in anything you don't want to get wet." supports the definition of "get" as "come into the possession of something concrete or abstract". This sense is the most appropriate because the speaker is advising against doing something that could lead to losing something valuable, which aligns with the meaning of "getting" something.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'refer', I would choose sense number 2: "be relevant to".

The reason why I chose this sense is that in the given context, the phrase "back-on-terra-firma toast" seems to imply a specific event or situation related to something else, and the speaker wants to clarify that they are not referring to the traditional celebration associated with popping open champagne bottles. Therefore, the sense of "refer" that best fits here is the one that means "be relevant to", which aligns well with the idea of clarifying the intended meaning of the term being used.

Here is my answer in the requested format:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence "I'm talking about landing in a canal" best matches sense 2 of the word "talk," which means "express in speech." This sense is supported by the fact that the sentence contains the verb "talk," indicating that someone is speaking or communicating something. The high frequency of this sense in a large corpus of texts also supports its selection as the most likely meaning in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of the word "pilot" is sense number 1:

Sense Number: 1

The definition of this sense of "pilot" aligns well with the context provided, where a person who speaks no English is mentioned. Therefore, it makes sense that the speaker is referring to someone who operates an aircraft in flight.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, I would choose sense number 2: "exchange thoughts; talk with".

The definition of this sense fits well with the situation described in the context: a pilot who speaks no English may not be able to communicate through spoken language, but they could still exchange thoughts or ideas through non-verbal means such as gestures or writing. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (53) is higher than any other option, which further supports its selection.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2."
Response: Sure! I will help you determine which sense of the word "refer" best fits the given context. After analyzing the provided information, I believe the most appropriate sense for the word "refer" in the given sentence is:

Sense Number: 2 - Be relevant to

The definition of this sense matches well with the usage of the word in the sentence, where it is used to describe how something is connected or related to other things. The frequency of this sense (18) also aligns with its prominence in the given text. Here is an example sentence that demonstrates this sense:

There were lots of questions referring to her talk.

In this sentence, the word "referring" means that there were many questions that were connected or related to the speaker's previous talk.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of "begin" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Take the first step or steps in carrying out an action.

The sentence "My maiden voyage and novitiates are referred to as virgins began at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field." implies that something new or unfamiliar is being initiated, which aligns with the definition of taking the first step in carrying out an action. Additionally, the mention of a "maiden voyage" and "novitiates" further supports this interpretation.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context you provided best fits sense number 2, "bring to an end or halt". In this sense, "ended" means to stop or discontinue something, such as a process, activity, or relationship. The phrase "began at dawn on a dew-sodden fairway and ended at noon in a soggy field" implies that the event or journey described came to an end at noon, indicating that the second sense of "end" is the most applicable.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word "flight" is sense number 2: an instance of traveling by air.

The definition of this sense aligns well with the context provided, as it refers to the act of traveling by air, which is what the text implies when it mentions balloon flights occurring at dawn or dusk when the winds are lightest. Additionally, the frequency of this sense matches the information provided, with six instances of this sense appearing in a large corpus of texts.

Therefore, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "occur" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Come to pass

The definition of this sense matches well with the context provided: "Balloon flights almost always occur at dawn or dusk, when the winds are lightest." The phrase "almost always" implies that balloon flights do indeed happen frequently, which supports the higher frequency of this sense (81) in the corpus. Additionally, the example sentence provided ("What is happening?") also aligns better with this sense than the other two options.
Response: Sense Number: 2
The word "come" in this context likely means "reach a destination; arrive by movement or progress." This sense is supported by the fact that the text mentions people moving around and arriving at different locations, such as "lots of standing around deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order the baskets hold no more than four passengers."
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I believe the most appropriate sense of "lot" is:

Sense Number: 2 - a parcel of land having fixed boundaries.

The context mentions "lots of standing around," which implies a physical space or area where people are gathered. The phrase "batch of letters" could also fit under this definition, as it refers to a group of items collected together. Additionally, the mention of "baskets" holding no more than four passengers suggests that the focus is on a specific plot of land with defined boundaries, rather than an abstract quantity or grouping of things.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would choose Sense Number 2: "follow with the eyes or the mind" as the best fit for the ambiguous word "watch".

The context describes a situation where people are gathered together and waiting for something to happen, such as the inflation of balloons. This implies that they are paying close attention and observing the process closely, which aligns well with the definition of Sense 2. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (64) is higher than any of the other options, indicating that it is the most commonly used meaning of "watch" in this context.

Therefore, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided information, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'balloon' is:

Sense Number: 2 - Small thin inflatable rubber bag with narrow neck.

The context describes a situation where there are multiple people gathered together and participating in activities related to hot air balloons, such as inflating them. This aligns better with the definition of a small, thin inflatable rubber bag that can be used for recreational purposes like flying in the air. The high frequency count of this sense (1) also supports this choice, indicating that it is a common usage of the term 'balloon'.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The definition you provided for the context fits best with sense number 2 of the possible senses of "inflate," which means to fill something with gas or air. In the given context, it makes perfect sense that the writer would use the verb "inflate" to describe the action of filling up balloons with air before they take off. Therefore, I vote for sense number 2 as the most appropriate interpretation of the verb in the given context.
Response: Sure thing! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I believe the best fit for the ambiguous word "stand" in the sentence is sense number 4: "hold one's ground; maintain a position; be steadfast or upright."

Here's why: In the given sentence, there are several instances where "stand" could potentially make sense in this sense. For instance, the phrase "standing around" could refer to people being in a stationary position, waiting or deliberating about something. Additionally, the phrase "deciding who would fly in what balloon and in what order" implies that individuals are taking turns or making choices, which aligns with the idea of holding one's ground or maintaining a position. Finally, the use of the term "baskets" to refer to the balloons themselves further supports this interpretation, as it implies a sense of stability or firmness. Therefore, I conclude that the best sense of "stand" in this context is sense number 4.

So, "Stand" in this context means: Stand (sense 4).
Response: Sense Number: 2 - bring to an end; settle conclusively

The context of the given passage suggests that the speaker is referring to the act of making a final decision or bringing something to a close. The phrase "decided after lengthy deliberations" implies that a conclusion has been reached through careful consideration. Therefore, sense 2 best fits the meaning of the word "decide" in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I believe the most appropriate sense of the verb "fly" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - Move quickly or suddenly.

The context describes a lot of activity involving balloons being inflated and people deciding who will fly in them and in what order, which suggests that the verb "fly" is being used to describe movement or action happening quickly or rapidly. The examples provided in the list also support this interpretation, as they all involve sudden movements or changes.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word 'basket' is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: a container that is usually woven and has handles

The context of the passage mentions "balloons" and "inflate," which suggest a more mundane and everyday usage of the word "basket." Additionally, there are multiple instances of the word "basket" throughout the passage, indicating its frequent occurrence. Therefore, it is more likely that the author intended the common meaning of "basket" as a container rather than any other rare or specialized meanings.
Response: Sense Number: 2
The given sentence highlights the second definition of "hold," which implies having something in one's hand or grip. In this context, it seems likely that the speaker is referring to physically holding objects such as balloons while they are being prepared for flying. Therefore, option two best fits the situation described in the passage.
Response: Sense Number: 2
The given context and the provided list of possible senses suggest that the best fit for the ambiguous word 'follow' in the sentence is sense number 2, which defines the verb as "be later in time."

In the context of the sentence, "When it wasn't my turn in the balloon I followed its progress from the `chase car`," it makes sense that the speaker is referring to the passage of time. The sentence implies that the speaker was observing the progress of the balloon over a period of time, rather than directly following it in real-time. Therefore, sense number 2 is the most suitable definition for the ambiguous word 'follow.'
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, the most appropriate sense of "progress" in this case is:

Sense Number: 3 - a movement forward

The context of the sentence provides evidence that the speaker is referring to the movement of something forward, such as the troops. This sense of "progress" aligns with the definition provided, which states that it refers to a movement forward, often towards a specific goal. Additionally, the frequency of this sense in a large corpus of texts supports its selection, as it occurs 5 times more frequently than the other two senses combined.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, the most appropriate sense of 'listen' in this case is:

"Sense Number: 2: listen and pay attention."

In this context, the speaker is referring to actively paying attention to something, which aligns with the second definition of 'listen'. The frequency of this sense (34) is also higher than the other two options, indicating that it is the most commonly used meaning of the word in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the context you provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambiguous word "driver" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: the operator of a motor vehicle

In this context, the word "driver" makes perfect sense as the person operating the motor vehicle being chased by the balloon. This definition matches the given information and the frequency of occurrence in a large corpus of texts supports this interpretation.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided, the most appropriate sense of the ambigious word 'holler' is:

"Sense Number: 1 - Definition: shout out; Frequency: 3; Example: He hollered out to surrender our weapons."

In this context, the word "holler" can be interpreted as meaning to shout or call out something, which aligns with the first definition and frequency provided.
Response: After analyzing the given text, I believe the best interpretation of the word "come" is sense number 2, which means "arrive at a place."

The context of the passage mentions "drifting above the Vosges," which implies being in a location higher than the ground level, and then observing things below. Also, the phrase "watching the silver mists rise off the river and the French cows amble about the fields" suggests a peaceful scene with a clear view of the surrounding area. Given these details, it seems unlikely that the speaker traveled far away from their current location or reached a different destination. Therefore, the most fitting definition of "come" in this scenario is sense number 2.

So, the answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: After analyzing the given text and considering all the possible meanings of the term "drift," I believe that Sense #1 best fits the context. In the passage, there is no indication that the speaker is wandering randomly or moving with no particular goal in mind; rather, they are describing themselves as having been in motion due to natural forces such as wind or currents. Therefore, Sense #1, which refers to being in motion due to some air or water current, seems like the most likely interpretation of the term "drif".t
Response: Sure thing! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "watch" is sense number 2: "follow with the eyes or the mind".

The usage of "watch" in the sentence suggests that the speaker is observing something with their eyes, but also implies some level of mental focus or attention. This fits well with the definition of sense number 2, which describes the act of paying close attention or keeping track of something.

Here is the breakdown of the frequencies you provided:

* Definition: follow with the eyes or the mind
Frequency: 64
* Example: Keep an eye on the baby, please!

Therefore, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "rise" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: move upward

The context mentions "drifting above the Vosges" which implies a vertical motion, and "the French cows amble about the fields", which refers to their movement on the ground. Additionally, there is no other sense that seems to fit perfectly in the context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. After analyzing the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'cow', I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1 - Female of domestic cattle.

The context of the passage provides evidence for this sense as it mentions "French cows" grazing in fields, which aligns with the definition of a female cow. Additionally, the frequency of this sense in a large corpus of texts (20) is higher than the other two options, indicating its common usage. Finally, there is no example available for sense number 2 or 3, which further supports choosing option 1 as the most likely meaning in this context.
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. After analyzing the context and the provided information, I believe the most appropriate sense of the ambigious word "amble" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: walk leisurely

The definition given for this sense matches well with the context of the passage, where the author describes enjoying a peaceful view of the landscape after a period of more active ground activity. The phrase "drifting above the Vosges" also conveys a sense of relaxation and slow movement, which aligns with the meaning of "walk leisurely". Additionally, the frequency of this sense (2) is consistent with the usage in the passage, as the author does not seem to be in a hurry or engaged in any strenuous physical activity.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given sentence "It's hard not to feel that God's in his heaven with this kind of bird's-eye view of the world..." implies that the speaker is expressing their personal belief or conviction, which aligns with the second definition of "feel" as "come to believe on the basis of emotion, intuition, or indefinite grounds." Therefore, the most appropriate sense of "feel" in this context is sense number 2.
Response: Sense Number: 2
"Keep" in this context likely means "continue a certain state, condition, or activity". This is supported by the phrase "keep on working!" which implies that the speaker wants the pilot to continue flying.
Response: Sense Number: 2: Definition: point out carefully and clearly; Frequency: 7; Example: He pointed out the mistake in her reasoning.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word "come" in the sentence you provided is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: move towards, travel towards something or somebody, or approach something or somebody.

In this sense, the verb "come" means that the people mentioned in the sentence (little French farmers and their wives) are moving towards the speaker, either physically or metaphorically. This interpretation is supported by the fact that they are coming out of their homes and putting their hands over their eyes to squint at the speaker, suggesting that they are approaching or moving towards them.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word 'put', I would choose Sense Number 2: cause to be in a certain state; cause to be in a certain relation.

The sentence 'little French farmers and their little French farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us' suggests that the speaker is describing an action where someone or something was caused to be in a certain state, possibly with a specific intention or purpose. Therefore, Sense Number 2 best fits the context of the sentence.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence "Eventually little French farmers and their little French farmwives came out of their stone houses and put their hands above their tiny eyes and squinted at us" suggests that the word "hand" in this case refers to a hired laborer on a farm or ranch. This sense of the word occurs 5 times in the Corpus of English Texts, which supports the idea that it is the most appropriate interpretation in this particular instance.
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: Sense Number: 2
Definition: reach a destination; arrive by movement or progress

In the given context, "come" can be interpreted as meaning "reach a destination." The sentence "We were coming down straight into their canal" implies that the speaker and their group were moving towards a specific location, specifically the canal. Therefore, sense number 2 best fits the context.
Response: Sense Number: 1
The given context and the words used suggest that the speaker is using the sense of "see" that means "perceive by sight or have the power to perceive by sight". In this context, the speaker is advising someone not to steal anything because they might be caught and seen by others. Therefore, the most appropriate sense of "see" to use here is sense number 1, which refers to the ability to perceive something visually.
Response: Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the verb "go" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Change location; move, travel, or proceed, also metaphorically.

The sentence "You can go only up or down by heating the balloon 's air with a propane burner , which does make the top of your head feel hot and ride the air currents." supports this sense of the verb "go", as it implies movement or progression in some manner, whether physically or metaphorically.
Response: Sense Number: 1
Response: Sure! I will do my best to help you identify the correct sense of the ambiguous word "air" in the given context. After analyzing the information provided, I believe the most appropriate sense for the word "air" in this case is:

Sense Number: 2 - The region above the ground.

The example sentence provided ("her hand stopped in mid-air") supports this choice, as it clearly refers to the concept of something being located in the vicinity of the sky or upper atmosphere. The other senses of "air" mentioned in the question do not seem to fit as well in this particular context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the information provided about each sense of the ambiguous word "burner," I would choose sense number 1 as the most appropriate definition.

"Sense Number: 1"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 8: "cause to do; cause to act in a specified manner" as the best fit for the word "make" in the sentence "You can go only up or down by heating the balloon 's air with a propane burner , which does make the top of your head feel hot and ride the air currents."

So, the answer is:

Sense Number: 8
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides strong evidence for the second definition of "top" as the highest or uppermost side of something. The sentence mentions "the top of your head" and "ride the air currents," both of which suggest a reference to the higher part of something rather than any other meaning of the word. While there are other definitions of "top" that could potentially apply in this context (such as the first definition as the upper part of anything), the combination of words and phrases in the sentence strongly support the second definition.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the available information, I would say that the best interpretation of the word "feel" in this sentence is sense number 2: "come to believe on the basis of emotion, intuitions, or indefinite grounds."

Here's why: In the sentence, the subject "you" goes through an action involving a physical sensation, specifically heating a balloon with a propane burner, which creates hot air that can be felt at the top of the head. However, the verb "feel" is not used to describe this physical sensation but rather to express the speaker's belief or conviction about what will happen as a result of the action. Therefore, sense number 2, which deals with believing or having faith without concrete evidence, seems like the most suitable choice.

So, my answer is: Sense Number: 2
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides evidence for sense 2 of 'ride', which means "be carried or travel on or in a vehicle". In this sentence, the subject "you" can go up or down by heating the balloon's air with a propane burner, suggesting that they are referring to a mode of transportation. Additionally, the phrase "ride the air currents" further supports this interpretation as it implies movement through the air using some form of conveyance. Therefore, the most appropriate sense of 'ride' in this context is sense 2.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given context best matches sense number 2 of the possible senses for the ambiguous word "current". In this sense, "current" means a steady flow of a fluid, usually from natural causes. The example provided in the question ("the raft floated downstream on the current") supports this interpretation.

According to the information provided, the frequency of this sense of "current" is relatively high, at 6. This suggests that it is a common and widely-used meaning of the word.
Response: 
Sense Number: 4
The given sentence "Which makes the chase car necessary" best fits sense number 4, "cause to do; cause to act in a specified manner". This sense is supported by the use of the verb "makes", which implies causing something to happen or to be in a particular state.
Response: Sure! I can help you determine which sense of the word "car" best fits the given context. After analyzing the information provided, I believe the most appropriate sense is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: a motor vehicle with four wheels; usually propelled by an internal combustion engine

The frequency of this sense is 71, indicating it is the most commonly used definition of the word "car". The example provided also supports this choice: "he needs a car to get to work." This sentence clearly refers to a personal vehicle used for transportation, which aligns with the first sense of "car".

Therefore, the answer is Sense Number 1.
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the context provided, the best definition of "go" in the given passage is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: change location; move, travel, or proceed, also metaphorically

In the passage, the author mentions that most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and most average a leisurely 5-10 miles per hour. This implies that the verb "go" here means moving or traveling in a specific location or direction, which fits with the first definition provided.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided senses, I would choose Sense Number 2: "achieve or reach on average".

The definition of "average" in this sense fits well with the context of the passage, as it refers to the speed at which balloonists travel, which is mentioned to be around 5-10 miles per hour. Additionally, the frequency of this sense (2) aligns with the usage in the given context, as the author mentions that most balloonists do not go higher than 2,000 feet and move at a relatively slow pace.

Here's my answer in the requested format:

"Sense Number: 2"
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the ambiguous word "hour", I would choose sense number 2, which defines "hour" as clock time.

The context of the passage mentions that most balloonists seldom go higher than 2,000 feet and average a leisurely 5-10 miles per hour, which aligns with the definition of "hour" as a unit of time measure. Additionally, the phrase "the hour is getting late" further supports this interpretation, as it implies a specific point in time rather than a general period of time.

Therefore, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! I can help you with that. Based on the given context and the information provided about the possible senses of the word "balloon," I would choose sense number 2 as the best fit. Here's why:

Sense Number: 2

Definition: small thin inflatable rubber bag with narrow neck
Frequency: 1
Example: No example available

The context provided mentions "little sense of motion" when the balloon is flying steadily at a certain height, which suggests that it is referring to something that is relatively stationary or not moving much. This fits better with the definition of sense number 2, which refers to a small, thin inflatable rubber bag with a narrow neck. This type of balloon is typically used for decoration or play and does not have the same level of lift or movement as a larger, more rigid balloon.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the possible senses of the word 'cruise', I would choose Sense Number 2: travel at a moderate speed.

The definition you provided fits well with the context of the sentence, where the speaker is describing a feeling of stability or lack of motion when the balloon is flying at a consistent height. The phrase "little sense of motion" suggests that the flight is smooth and stable, which aligns with the meaning of traveling at a moderate speed.

Additionally, the frequency of this sense of the word 'cruise' supports my choice, as it occurs twice in the provided examples. Overall, I believe that Sense Number 2 best captures the intended meaning of the author in the given context.

Therefore, my answer is:

Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the provided list of possible senses, I would choose Sense Number 1: Definition: travel up.

The sentence "Only when one is ascending — or in our case descending a tad trop rapidemente — does one feel, well, airborne in a picnic basket" suggests that the speaker is using the verb "ascend" in its primary meaning of going up or higher. This sense is supported by the fact that the sentence mentions "descending," which implies that "ascend" refers to the opposite direction. Additionally, the phrase "feel airborne" suggests a physical movement upward, which aligns with the definition of "travel up." Therefore, Sense Number 1 best fits the context and meaning of the sentence.

So, my answer is:

"Sense Number: 1"
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given sentence " Only when one is ascending — or in our case descending a tad trop rapidemente— does one feel, well, airborne in a picnic basket" implies that the speaker is using the second definition of " descend", which means "come from; be connected by a relationship of blood, for example". In this context, the speaker is likely referring to the ancestry or lineage of someone or something. Therefore, I believe the most appropriate answer is sense number 2.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The given sentence "What 's he doing ?" implies that the speaker is asking about what someone is doing, which aligns best with the second definition of "do" as carrying out or performing an action.

Response: Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and possible senses of the word "leap," I would choose sense number 2, which defines "leap" as "pass abruptly from one state or topic to another."

The context of the given passage supports the second definition of "include" where it means "consider as part of something." In this case, the author is describing the activities they performed after reaching their balloon, including the act of pulling it to the ground, deflating it, rolling it up, and putting it away in a trailer. It makes sense that the author would use this definition of "include" to describe these actions as part of the overall process of dealing with the balloon.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context you provided best matches sense number 2 of "routine," which refers to a short theatrical performance that is part of a longer program. In the given passage, the author mentions "the precision routine of yanking the balloon to the ground" and "he did his act three times every evening," which both suggest that the word "routine" here means a specific performance or act within a broader program or series of performances. Therefore, I conclude that the most appropriate sense of "routine" in this context is sense number 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the most appropriate sense of "yank" in this case is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: pull, or move with a sudden movement

The context describes someone pulling something (the balloon) to the ground, which aligns with the definition of "pull" or "move with a sudden movement." The frequency of this sense (5) also supports this interpretation, as it suggests that this meaning of "yank" is relatively common in English language usage. Finally, the example sentence provided further reinforces this choice by using the verb "jerked," which also implies a sudden, forceful movement.
Response: Sense Number: 2
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would choose Sense Number 2: "the region above the ground". In this context, "air" refers to the space above the ground where the balloon is located. It is the most obvious choice considering the mention of the balloon being pulled to the ground, pumped dry, rolled up, and put inside a trailer. The other senses do not seem to fit quite well in the given scenario.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the word "roll_up" is:

    Sense Number: 1 - Form into a cylinder by rolling.

The definition you provided fits well within the context of the passage, where the author describes the act of "rolling up" the balloon after they have finished using it. Additionally, this sense has a higher frequency than any other option in the corpus of texts, suggesting that it is the most common meaning of the term in this context.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, the most appropriate sense of the ambigious word "cram" is:

Sense Number: 1 - Definition: crowd or pack to capacity

The context of the passage clearly shows that the author is describing the act of fitting things into a small space, such as the balloon and its basket being crammed into a trailer after they were deflated and taken apart. This usage aligns best with Sense 1, where the word means to crowd or pack something to capacity.

Response: Sense Number: 1

The context of the sentence "It was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole" suggests that the speaker is referring to physical activity or exercise as a form of keeping fit. Therefore, the first definition of "exercise" as "the activity of exerting your muscles in various ways to keep fit" is the most appropriate sense in this case.
Response: Sense Number: 3

The context of the sentence provides evidence that the speaker is using the third sense of "have" which means "to go through (mental or physical states or experiences)". This sense is supported by the fact that the sentence mentions exercising in the morning, which implies some kind of mental or physical experience. Additionally, the phrase "it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole" suggests that the experience of exercising led directly to some other action, further supporting the third sense of "have".
Response: Sense Number: 1

The given sentence "It was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole" can be interpreted in several ways using different meanings of the verb "follow". However, the most appropriate interpretation in this case is sense #1: "to travel behind, go after, come after".

In this context, "followed" means that the speaker and others had some physical activity earlier in the morning, which was then followed by going somewhere else, specifically reaching a nearby watering hole.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context and the list of possible senses, I would choose sense number 2: "travel or be transported in a vehicle".

The sentence "It was the most exercise we 'd had all morning and it was followed by our driving immediately to the nearest watering hole" clearly implies that the speaker and others were traveling in a vehicle after their morning exercise. Therefore, sense number 2 best fits the context.
Response: Sense Number: 2

The context of the sentence provides evidence for the second definition of "mean" which is "have as a logical consequence". In this sentence, "mean" refers to the result or outcome of something happening. For instance, "the water shortage means that we have to stop taking long showers", implies that there will be less water available if people continue to take long showers, resulting in consequences such as limited access to water for other uses. Therefore, the best fit for the given context is sense number 2.
Response: Sure! Based on the given context, I would say that the best fit for the ambiguous word 'return' is sense number 2: "give back".

The context mentions "Cinzano umbrellas" which implies a European setting, and the reference to "espresso" also points towards Europe. Additionally, the phrase "me nursing an espresso" suggests a leisurely activity, which aligns with the idea of giving something back. Furthermore, there is no clear indication of any other sense being more relevant in the context.

Therefore, I conclude that the best sense of the ambiguous word 'return' in this context is sense number 2: "give back".
Response: Sure, I can help you with that! Based on the given context and the seven possible senses of the word "watch", I would say that the best fit is sense number 2: "follow with the eyes or the mind".

The context of the passage mentions watching something, specifically the French golfers, which aligns well with this sense of the word. The phrase "Keep an eye on" also implies a mental act of observation rather than just physical seeing, which supports this interpretation. Therefore, I believe that sense number 2 is the most appropriate choice.

So, "Sense Number: 2"

The given context supports the definition of "duffer" as an incompetent or clumsy person. The phrase "French duffers mauling the first tee" implies that the individuals in question are not skilled at golf, which aligns with the first sense of "duffer".

This sense fits well with the context provided, as the author mentions people sitting under umbrellas at a golf course, which aligns with the definition of being present in a particular location without a specific goal or purpose. Additionally, the absence of any examples for the other senses in the provided list supports this choice. Therefore, my answer is:

Response: Sense Number: 2

The context you provided best matches sense #2 of "ego," which refers to one's consciousness of their own identity.

Here's why: In the context of the sentence you provided, it makes the most sense that "clamber" means to climb awkwardly, rather than any of the other possible meanings. The phrase "chase car" implies that there were people who needed to be transported somewhere quickly and safely, which suggests that the act of climbing into the vehicle was not straightforward or easy. Therefore, using the sense of "clamber" that refers to climbing awkwardly fits best with the overall meaning of the sentence.

Additionally, there are many instances of this definition of "ride" in a large corpus of texts, indicating that it is a common usage of the word.
