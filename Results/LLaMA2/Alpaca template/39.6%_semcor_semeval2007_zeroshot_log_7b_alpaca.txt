The given sentence can be interpreted as "Have" means "have as a feature". This sense matches best with the context of the sentence, as the author mentions "homeless people", which suggests that the topic is related to social issues and public policy, rather than private matters like employment contracts or personal relationships. Additionally, the phrase "obviously" implies that the issue being discussed is already known or obvious, further supporting the idea that "have" should be understood in this sense.

    In the given context, the author seems to be arguing against the idea that reducing federal housing assistance programs caused an increase in homelessness.

Response: Sense Number: 2

The target word 'view' in the given context most likely refers to the second definition which is "the visual percept of a region".

Response: Lean can take on multiple meanings depending on the context. However, considering the given sentence and the provided definitions, I would say that the most appropriate meaning of lean in this case is sense number 1: to incline or bend from a vertical position. The speaker mentions reaching back to French class, which suggests a more formal setting, and the use of the word montgolfière also implies a more structured situation. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the speaker intended sense number 2 (cause to lean or incline), sense number 3 (have a tendency or disposition to do or be something), or sense number 4 (rely on for support) in this context. As for sense number 5 (cause to lean to the side), it does not seem relevant to the given sentence. So, I conclude that the best answer is:
